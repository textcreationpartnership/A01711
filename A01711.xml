            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the Iewes, at ſuch time as our Sauiour Chriſt came into the worlde, had the word of God among them: and had alſo the Temple and Synagogues where they heard the ſame read &amp; expounded: yet their ſtate was very miſerable, for Chriſt ſaith, they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21168:5"/>were as ſheep without a ſhepheard: becauſe their teachers, the Scribes and Phariſies, being choaked with couetouſnes, and puffed vp with vaine glory, were become ſtark naught, corrupt in maners, &amp; corrupting the word with their fond gloſes: their teaching alſo was ſo cold, and with ſo little pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er euen in that which they taught truly, that the people had no great liſt to heare them. But when <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> the forerunner of Chriſt, was raiſed vp to publiſh the beginning of the Goſpell, and to prepare the way for the Lord, hee like a ſounding and ſhrill Trumpet, with the power of his word ſhooke their hearts, and rowſed their drowſineſſe, ſo that from his time the kingdome of heauen ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered violence. When Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his voice in preaching, and his diuine power in working woonders, there appeared ſuch a woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull maieſtie in his perſon, as did amaze the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: wherupon his fame was noyſed far and neer, ſo that they came running out of al quarters of the land by heaps, for to ſee and hear him: they ſeemed to forget themſelues and their ſtate, in leauing all worldly affaires, as the husbandmen their plough, the Artificers their craftes and ſciences, following him into the wilderneſſe with their wiues and their children laggering at their heeles, ſo great was their zeale. So that, as before almoſt all did periſh in the miſerable ſtate they were in: nowe it ſeemed that the greateſt part, or at leaſt an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable multitude did with ſuch care imbrace the heauenly doctrine, as that they ſhould be moſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21168:5"/>happy and come to eternal life: but this was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for our Sauiour Chriſt ſheweth heere, that of this great heap and rablement of people, that were ſo zealous, and trauelled ſo far to heare him, there were three partes which did not profite by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but continued ſtill damned and forlorne creatures, only one part of foure, are true ſchollers. And becauſe we be rank hypocrits, prone &amp; ready to deceiue our ſelues, Chriſt Ieſus layeth open the matter ſo plainlie, &amp; in ſo familiar a kind of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that vnles we wilfully blind our ſelues we can not but ſee how the caſe ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in euery of vs, ech man in himſelfe: for he taketh a ſimilitude from a Sower of corn, which going &amp; caſting his ſeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, it lighteth vpon ſundry kindes of ground, ſome falleth by the way ſide, where the path is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled &amp; beaten ſmooth &amp; hard by mens feet, and is made like a pauement, &amp; there it lyeth aboue the ground altogether vncouered, the Fouls come by &amp; by &amp; pick it vp. Some falleth into ſtony ground or rocky, or as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, vpon a rock: where there is a litle thin cruſt of earth in the top, &amp; ſome moiſture in which the ſeed is a little couered: and becauſe the earth which doth couer it is but ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it ſpringeth vp quicklie and brancheth, and is freſh and greene, and being ſo good, ſeemeth to be forward corne, and ſuch as would yeeld to the husbandmen a plentifull harueſt: but becauſe the root cannot ſpread it ſelfe deepe ynough, to ſuck iuice out of the ground for the nouriſhment of the blade, when the parching heate of the Sun lighteth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21168:6"/>vpon it, then it is dryed vp, and ſcorched, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp; neuer bringeth forth fruit. Some other doth fall among thornes: there is depth of earth for the feed to grow, ſo that it ſpringeth vp, and not onely a blade, but alſo a ſtalke, and commeth ſo far as to haue the eare: but the thornes grow vp with it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſhadow and choak it, in ſo much that the corne in the eare, cannot haue the benefite of the Sun to make it ripe: therefore the fruite that it ſeemeth to bring forth commeth to naught. Some other ſeeds fall into good ground, and grow vp, &amp; bring forth ſeaſonable fruit, one kernell an hundreth, another ſixty, another thirtie. This is the Parable. Now for the meaning of it, we are not to ſeek far, neither to goe by coniectures, for Chriſt himſelfe doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and interpret euery part of it a little after in this chapter: I neede not but to lay open his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>The ſeed is the word of God: the ſower of it is the Preacher and publiſher of the ſame: for as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer doth fil his hand and ſo caſteth it abroad vpon the ground, not ſetting it ſeed by ſeed, or chooſing a place for euery ſeed, but where it lighteth: euen ſo the preacher doth caſt foorth the worde among the people, and look how the ground is into which it falleth, ſo doth it proſper; for your hearts are the ground vpon which it is caſt: you that are the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers &amp; among whom the ſeed is ſown, haue euery one a hart which is one of theſe four ſorts of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, vpon which the ſeed falleth: and becauſe the ſeede hath beene and is ſtill daylie ſowne among yee, I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21168:6"/>thinke this parcell of ſcripture is vey fit and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, euen as a touchſtone for euery one to try him ſelfe withall, whether hee haue rightlie embraced the Goſpell, and to his ſaluation: for what a ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhnes were this, when we haue ſo iuſt and plaine a rule, not to meaſure our ſelues with it? But going on, on, nothing conſider whether we be not one of thoſe three euill ſorts of ground, which receiue the ſeed, but bring forth no fruite, thinking we be wel if we profeſſe the Goſpel or heare it, after any ſort. Let vs go forward: thoſe which receiue the ſeede by the way ſide, are they which heare the worde and doe not vnderſtand it, then commeth the euill one, or as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, the Diuell, and taketh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from their heart. In theſe firſt kind of hearers, we haue to obſerue, how that their heartes being hard and ſmooth like a path that is trampled and beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with mens feet, the word hath no entrance, but lieth aboue vncouered: for like as when a man caſteth an handfull of corne vpon a very harde and ſmooth path, it is all one as if it were caſt vpon a pauement: ſo alſo through the cuſtome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe of ſinning, the Diuell hath made the hearts of theſe vnmeete to receiue the heauenly ſeed of the word: and looke how ye ſee Crowes &amp; other Fowles followe the heeles of the Sower, to picke vp and deuoure ſuch kernels as do lie vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered; in like maner do the diuels come like gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy foules into the aſſemblies, where the word of God is preached, to take it away from the harts of the people, that it may not growe there. This
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21168:7"/>peraduenture will ſeeme ſtrange to ſome, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſhould haue any entrance into the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Gods people, eſpecially when they bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beſt and moſt holy exerciſes of hearing the word &amp; of praier. How ſtrange ſoeuer it may ſeeme, and how many ſoeuer haue been, or bee of that fond and doltiſh opinion, to think that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell hath nothing to do with them, or commeth not neere them, when they bee about theſe holie things: we are to beleeue Chriſt who telleth vs the contrary: and we are wiſely to conſider, that when we are nigheſt that which ſhoulde doe our ſoules good, then is this enemie readieſt at hand, &amp; doth moſt buſilie beſtirre him. If this were not vttered by our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, we might woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; for mine own part I would not ceaſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to ſee many hearers which cary away al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing, which is to any purpoſe: let a man tell a long ſtorie in a worldly matter, they haue wit inough to recite it in order again, &amp; to keep it in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance a long time after: but let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preacher ſpeak neuer ſo plain, although they ſit &amp; look him in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> face, yet if ye enquire of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſoon as they be out at the church doors, ye ſhal eaſily perceiue that (as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſaying is) it went in at the one eare, and out at the other. They will ſay peraduenture, after this maner, it was a good ſermon, I wold we could follow it, he ſaid very wel: he is a perfect rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy man in the pulpit. But ask, what doctrine did he handle. Then are they at a pauſe, and ſet at a dead lift. They will make this anſwere: we are not able
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21168:7"/>to carrie away ſo much as other can; neuertheles we hope that we be as good toward God, as they that carie away moſt. They will alſo confeſſe that the worde of God is good, and that wee ſhould be ruled by it. Let vs therefore dearly beloued (if we deſire not to be of the number of theſe) marke well the ſubtill ſleights and pollicie of the diuell, how he handleth and conueyeth the matter with this kind of people. There is no doubt of this, but that if he can he will drawe away the minde from comming to the Sermon, one pelting let or other muſt come in the way: if there be no worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe to be done, then a paire of cards, or tables, or ſome honeſt recreation, it ſhould be nowe no good ciuility to part companie when friends are met togither, this is the ſureſt way if it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: but what if he faile heerin? They come to the place where the ſeed ſhal be ſowne, ſit down, and mind to heare: then the next way is to come with them, and to attend at their elbowe, ſeeking how to depriue them of the word. Now his beſt way is to bring them aſleepe becauſe they were then as good bee abſent: or into a ſlumber, that they may heare only a ſound and a confuſed hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, without any perſeuerance of the things vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: or els when they heare any perfect ſentence, or a few ſentences, they know not why they bee vttered, becauſe they heard not that which went before. Such as are not ſo drowſie headed, being wakefull, he ſeeketh ſtil to conuey ſome thoughts into their minds, whereabouts they may be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21168:8"/>and their vnderſtanding drawne away: the mind of a man being light and inconſtant, if hee can put in but one motion, it oftentimes draweth with it ſo many linkes as make vp a whole chaine, in the meane time the Preacher goeth on, and he vnderſtandeth not what was ſaid, and ſo when his mind returneth he can haue no ſound knowledge of the things vttered, but a confuſed opinion: into theſe by thoughtes men are oftentimes brought, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by occaſion of ſome word or ſentence which they heard vttered, and are carried ſo far, that they cannot of long time recouer their mind to bring it again to the matter. Seeing this great da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, we ought when we come to hear Gods word taught, to make account that wee goe about a verie hard worke, that we go to encounter with Sathan hand to hand, who ſeeketh then moſt buſilie to ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our heart, that he may make that word fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in vs, and cauſe vs to ſinne grieuouſly againſt God. There is no one man which maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of hearing the word rightly, which ſetting theſe thinges togither, the reuerence we owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, the ſtedineſſe of our minde, which ſhould be vpon it, and the care to keepe it, but will eaſilie grant that it is as hard and painfull a trauell to doe this, as for the man that worketh in the ſoreſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie labor. Heer is therfore a leſſon for euery man to apply to himſelf when he is going to heare the word, to think I am now going about a gret work I ſhall be too weak if the Lord God do not migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie aſſiſt me: for I am not to ſit downe there at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21168:8"/>eaſe, but to wraſtle and ſtruggle with the Diuell, and with all the corruptions of mine owne fleſh, and hardneſſe of my heart: that my mind may bee kept ſtedfaſt vpon the worde, that I may receiue it with al reuerence &amp; feare, as the word of the great &amp; glorious God: not to iudge of it at mine own pleaſure, but to craue wiſedome from the Lord: not to heare it and to let it goe, but to keep it as a moſt precious iewell locked vp in my heart, that I may guide my ſelfe thereby. And wee ſhall be a great deale the rather mooued to this diligence, if we conſider what a companion wee carie about with vs, and what a gueſt wee lodge withall, when we be ſuch as heare the word, and doe not keep it. For Chriſt telleth vs that it is the Diuell which doth this: which as a greedy Fowle deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſeed which was ſowne in our heart: if any make none account to haue him poſſeſſing their mind, &amp; hardening their hearts againſt the word: then let them continue in their ſloth to heare with drowſie minds, to heare and not to vnderſtand: to regard the holy word, but as the word of a man: to make little account to keep it. But if he thinke it a moſt miſerable thing, to haue ſo filthy a beaſt, &amp; ſo ſoule a ſpirit to lodge in his breaſt: if he thinke it to be a moſt vile ſlauery, to be vanquiſhed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome of ſo horrible an enemie, to bee led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and kept thrall vnder ſuch a tyrant: then let him thinke alſo how miſerable a thing it is to bee ſuch a kind of ground as doth receiue the ſeede by the way ſide. For vndoubtedly, how ſoeuer men
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21168:9"/>ſeeme to defie the deuill, and curſe him, as though he ſhould not come nigh them, yet ſeeing it is no mortall man, but the Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, who telleth vs heer that the diuell is not only nigh but in theſe kind of hearers, euen hardening their heartes, and blinding their eies, wee ought moſt conſtantlie to beleeue it. Hee that ſhall deeply weigh the eſtate of our Church at this day, will ſoone be brought to confeſſe, that there be many of this firſt ſort of hearers, they ſhall perceiue it right wil by this, that they are not able in any wiſe to iudge or put difference betweene ſound &amp; ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere preaching and vaine pratling: they know not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preacher doth miniſter vnto them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, and when there is nothing but chaffe and wind: ye ſhal heare them highly commende ſome Sermon, as a matter worthy to be written in letters of gold, when as in deed it deſerueth not ſo much as to be noted with a coale. I ſpeake not of thoſe ſilly wretches, which were neuer as yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with preaching, for it is no great maruel, though they bee not able to diſcerne chalke from cheeſe: or being blind for to iudge of colours, but to ſuch as of long time haue been hearers, and yet neuer the wiſer, becauſe they are not able to iudge when ſound and neceſſary concluſions are drawne out of the word; but all is one with them, whether the reaſon that is made be good or bad, ſtrong or weake: yea, further ye ſhall perceiue that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a litle ſhew of a reaſon although neuer ſo dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, being againſt true godlines, doth more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21168:9"/>with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then a multitude of infallible proofs although they be neuer ſo ſure: and that which is ſo groſſe and abſurd that a child may laugh at, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to them a very ſtrong piller to leane to. There needeth no more when a man preacheth vnto them, but a glorious ſhew of learning, a ſweet ringing voice, and matters ſo ſtrange and ſtrangely handeled, that they may be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a woonderme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that they know not. And Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath many chaplaines fit for this turne, to ſerue the vaine humor of ſuch people, and to ſet foorth themſelues after a pompous ſort: more ſeeking their owne vaine glory, then the glorie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in the conuerſion of the people. The ſeconde kind of ground are they which receiue the ſeede vpon the hard rock, where there is ſome entrance, and the word hath a ſhallow root in them, for as it were the top of their heart is ſoft after a ſort, and there it is couered a little, and it groweth vp quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſpringeth freſh, they ſeeme to be ſtout and excellent profeſſours, they brag of great zeale: a man would take them to be ſyncere, and ſo they take themſelues: but when the Sun ariſeth that is, the fiery triall or parching heate of perſecution, they ſtumble and fall away and becauſe the word had no deep root in them, it withereth and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth no fruite: theſe alſo are not profited by the word of grace, but are ſtil caſtawayes &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned creatures. In this kind of ground, or in theſe hearers, if we note well, we ſhall ſee that which is ſtrange and woonderfull: when Chriſt ſaith and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21168:10"/>teſtifieth of them, that they receiue the word with ioy: theſe be not blaſphemers or perſecutors of the word: they be not contemners which regard not at all to heare it: they come not vnder a ſhewe or pretence as to a thing which otherwiſe they haue no care nor feeling of, or which they delight not for to heare, but how? They receiue it with ioy, and take ſuch pleaſure therin, that returning they can ſay, ſurely this was a very notable peece of worke, and wel handeled, I am glad that I heard it, it doth me euen as much good as my meate, I would goe a mile to heare the like againe. Is not this then marueilous and fearfull, that a man may goe thus far &amp; yet be a caſtaway, and a forlorne wretch? It is not a thing to be woondered at, when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcriptures giue ſentence againſt thoſe traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous villaines, which ſet themſelues againſt God, and tread downe his lawes; but when God vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this ſharpe ſentence againſt this zealous kind of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if it cauſe vs not to wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, yet it may make vs to tremble, when we ſee that a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus far in religion and yet be damned. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we vnderſtand that a man may bee zealous, and ready to heare preaching, vnderſtandeth, carieth away, letteth it grow in his heart, hath ſome ioy in it, and yet neuer the better, abiding ſtill vnder the curſe. But there be ſome which will obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me and ſay, this is no good manner of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, for the vſe of true teaching, is to builde vp and edifie the faith: but this ſeemeth to take away the certainty of faith from all, ſo that no man can
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21168:10"/>tell whether he ſhall be ſaued: For by what means can a man make a better triall and proofe of his faith then this, that he giueth eare to Gods word, vnderſtandeth it, carieth it away, and ioyeth in it? If ſuch a man may be damned, who may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire? I anſwere with S. Paul, 1. Cor. 10.12. He that thinketh he ſtandeth, let him take heed he do not fall. If the admonition were neceſſary to the Corinthes, it is neceſſarie for vs all. One of the principall endes and vſes of preaching, is to giue men warning that they do not deceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with euery kind of faith or ioy in the word: but to looke for good and ſound triall in themſelues: which is not the way to bring men to deſpaire, but to bring them to true godlineſſe: to cauſe them to ſhake off ſecuritie and looſneſſe in the ſeruice of God: to beware leaſt their heartes bee hard ſtill within: it cauſeth men to trie themſelues leaſt they ſhould be deceiued by a vaine ſhadowe of a dead and fruitleſſe faith: for Chriſt ſaith, that theſe beleeue (for ſo it is expreſſed by S. Luke the 8.13.) and ioy in the worde, and yet are damned. Then let vs come to the particular applying of this point: to ſee howe wee are to deale with our ſelues, when ye receiue the word take heed that ye giue it depth of earth enough, look that your hart be not ſoft &amp; pliable enough a little aboue, and a hard rocke of ſtone within, but ſee that it bee dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ſoftened to the bottome, that the worde may take deep roote enough. Alas, what a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing is it, when Chriſt hath giuen vs war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21168:11"/>here ſo plainly, for a man to be a zealous goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller, not only willing to heare, but hath an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire, &amp; trauelleth to heare, taketh pleaſure &amp; delight when he heareth, yet neuertheles, becauſe he taketh no heede thereto, his heart within is ſo ſtonie, that he heareth but to his further increaſe of damnation. Manie thinke it goeth wel with them when as they receiue this teſtimonie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men: he is a ſound Proteſtant he fauoureth and delighteth in the truth, theſe indeed be great tokens of the fear of God, but yet we are not to reſt in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: our chief dealing is between God &amp; our hart, &amp; that in this thing whether our heart bee not hard and rockie. Thoſe are a thouſande times happy, which feele melting heartes and ſoft affections, ſo that Gods word doth pearce into them, &amp; cauſeth them to tremble at the maieſty &amp; power of the fame: their tender heart doth ſigh and mourn for their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. As on the contrary part, they which make no conſcience of ſin, but are hardened in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, although they ſeem to be in good caſe, yet are they curſed &amp; miſerable. Let euery man therefore that goeth from the ſermon, carie this with him: I heare by Chriſts owne words, that there is a ſtonie ground where the ſeed falleth, where it groweth, but not deep enough, it ſpringeth vp, but doth not bring forth fruit, this is a wofull caſe, if I ſhould be in the number of theſe, for then al my labor is loſt which I beſtow in freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yea it were much better that I had neuer heard: I feele that I ioy in it, I would not for any thing but I had heard
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21168:11"/>it: but Chriſt ſaith that the reprobate ſome of them do heare the word with ioy, ſo that if I looke not narrowly to mine owne heart, I may for all this be damned: therefore I muſt not ſatisfie my ſelfe with this, but ſee that I couer the word deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that my heart be ſoftened in ſuch ſort, that I feele the roote goeth deepe, yea ſo deepe, that it can neuer be rooted out: And therefore let him continuallie crie vnto God and ſay: O Lord make ſoft my harde and ſtony heart, let it bee a melting heart, that thy holie worde may growe in it for euer. I would to God this doctrine of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt might make euerie of vs to tremble &amp; ſhake (as indeed if it were well weighed, it is ſo fearfull, that it might cauſe the haire of our heads to ſtand vp,) for then would we not ſo looſely &amp; ſecurely walk in the hardneſſe of our heartes, there would not be ſo many backſliders in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: there would not be ſo many braue boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and praters of Religion, who are readie to pull in their hornes, and to hide their heades, ſo ſoone as there is anie feare of daunger, or likelihood of perſecution: neither would men bear themſelues in hand, that they be iolly profeſſours when they haue but a little taſted of the word, &amp; are no more but empty barrelles, which giue a great ſound. Heere then wee be ſet a worke with great toyle, to haue this ſame hard ſtonie ground made ſofte, and fit to receiue this heauenly ſeed. And hee which is not carefull in this point, to take paines, yee ſhall ſee him waxe ſo hard, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21168:12"/>euen as a continuall raine dropping vpon a rocke of ſtone maketh it neuer the ſofter, ſo nothing can make his heart to relent. This may teach vs then to ceaſe marueiling, when wee ſee ſo manie which willinglie giue themſelues to be taught, &amp; haue ſtill little remorſe of ſinne. The Lorde for his mercie ſake make vs wiſe and ſharpe ſighted to iudge of our ſelues: not to be lead on forward in a carnall profeſſion, but to giue credit to our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly teacher, who hath heere opened his holie mouth to inſtruct vs ſo plainely, and before hand to warne vs of the great danger: that we may ſtir vp ourſelues, and be quickened in our dull ſpirits, with all humble ſubmiſſion, and bowing downe our neckes, to receiue the doctrine of our Lord, &amp; to open our hearts in ſuch ſort, that he may digge in them, and thruſt in his ſpade to the bottome: for otherwiſe, it cannot go wel with vs. If this were practiſed among vs, wee ſhould not haue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old ruſty Proteſtants: which if a man talk with them from morning to night, they are able to continue ſpeech in reciting ſtories and places of Scripture, and will vtter matter againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Pope: but let a man vrge them with the doctrine of regeneration, and ſtand vpon the neceſſitie of ſincere repentance, ſhewing them that they muſt be truly humbled vnder the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſinnes, that they muſt mortifie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their carnall luſtes: this is too hard a cruſt for their old teeth. This matter doth marre all: this doth rob them of their glorie: and therefore they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21168:12"/>can not wilinglie abide to heare of it. Let vs come now to the third kind of ground, which receiueth the ſeed among the thornes: here is depth enough of earth: ſo that as the ſecond ſort of hearers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to goe far beyond the firſt, ſo theſe ſeeme to goe far beyond them, and to come nigher to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, for heere the worde doth grow &amp; hath root ſo deep, that it ſpringeth foorth ſo farre that Chriſt faith, it groweth vp, and the thornes growe vp with it, the ſtalke doth ſhoot foorth the eare, and lacketh but riping. For this may bee proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Saint Luke, who ſaith that they bee not <hi>(Teleſphorountes)</hi> that is, ſuch as beare ripe and timely fruit: for theſe profeſſors doe manie good workes, and ſeeme to bring foorth the fruites of the Goſpel, and that in ſuch wiſe that men cannot alwayes diſcerne them, but thinke their deeds to be notable: but Chriſt Ieſus doth ſhew that their workes before God, (who only cannot bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) are as corne which lacketh riping, which being ouerſhadowed with buſhes, withereth in the eare and commeth to naught: this is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous caſe if wee looke not to it: That a man may heare the Goſpell preached, carie it away, be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereby to doe many good workes, and yet be damned. Hee is a thouſand folde mad therefore, which doth not looke to himſelfe in this point: to trie what ſoundneſſe there is in the fruites of his faith, and how ſincerely hee doth imbrace Gods worde. As before I ſaide, that ſome would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect &amp; ſay, this will deſtroy the faith, ſo am I ſure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21168:13"/>that heer it will be ſaid much more: becauſe this ſeemeth to take away the ſureſt tryall of faith: if a man may not by and by ſay, I haue good works, therfore I haue the true and liuely faith: I anſwere, that whoſoeuer hath any good worke in him, the ſame hath the true faith, which hath brought foorth that good worke, becauſe it is impoſſible without faith to do any good thing, or to haue any good motion or intent: but withall I ſay, that it is one thing to ſeem good before men: and another thing for to be good indeed before God. In out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, there is little differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between the good deeds of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which feare god ſincerely, &amp; the vntimely fruite of worldlings: but God whoſe eie doth not look vpon the outward ſhew but the inward affection, ſeeth which proceedeth of faith, and which doth proceed of vaine glorie, or ſome other ſiniſter reſpect, and putteth as great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he did between the ſacrifices of Caine and Abel. Wee muſt take heed then, that the fruits of our faith be ripe &amp; timely, otherwiſe they be good but in ſhew. We muſt come then to ſee firſt what theſe thornes are: in S. Matt. they are called, <hi>the cares of this world, &amp; the deceitfulnes of riches:</hi> in S. Luk. <hi>the cares of riches, &amp; pleaſures of this life.</hi> And in very deed theſe thornes do growe togither. For were it not for the pleaſures of this life, there would bee no cares of riches: hee which doth ſeek greedily for welth, it is either becauſe he would be able to haue wherwithal to fill the luſtes of the fleſh, and to pamper his body delicately: or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21168:13"/>els to ſetforth himſelf in pride, &amp; to climb ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly vnto honour. For ſo long as a man doth take pleaſure in any of theſe, ſo long he is couetous, &amp; raketh together ſo much, that as the common ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, he raketh vp the diuel &amp; all. What muſt we do then? Our hearts are as a ground that is rank, &amp; bringeth forth many weedes: we are ſet a work as God ſpeaks by his prophet Ieremy, chap 4.4. Plow vp your fallow, &amp; ſow not among the thorns: we muſt put al dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; care that our hearts may be rid of ſuch noiſom weeds as wil choke the word of God, &amp; make that it ſhall not bring foorth fruit in vs. So long as we ſuffer any of theſe in vs, either to loue dainty &amp; delicate feeding of our fleſh, &amp; to fil our ſelues with the luſts therof, or to be gallant in the eies of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; hautily to lift vp our ſelues in our vain glorious minds, &amp; for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of theſe delightes bend our care to the world: ſo long ſhall we be vnprofitable ſchollers in the ſchool of chriſt Alas poor men which wold fain come to God, &amp; yet are glued to the worlde they offer one hand to Chriſt, &amp; the other to the diuel: they can talk of the ſpirit, and yet are led by the fleſh: the goſpel is in their mouth, and couetouſneſſe lodgeth in their hearts: their works gliſter &amp; are green before men &amp; are withered before God: they ſeem to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; are faithleſſe: to be heires of glory, &amp; yet are the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion: there are gret ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of theſe hearers, &amp; ſpecially in ſuch places, where there is welth &amp; honors: how many fal away choked with the world? and yet we are not afraid of ourſelues
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21168:14"/>to take heede that we ſtand faſt. A great mercy of God it is that we haue not only the doctrine laide before vs, but alſo fearefull examples: ſo that we may buy our wit with other mens coſt. For when wee ſee the world with delightes and pleaſures, with couetouſneſſe and ambition, to carrie away thoſe which profeſſe the Goſpell, is not our owne matter in hand, are not we made of the ſame met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall they are, doth not the world aſſault vs as it doth them? Yes, and we ſhall be ouercome alſo, if the Lord haue not mercie vpon vs. The hardnes of this worke, ought not to diſcourage or make vs ſlack, but hearing what Chriſt ſaith, whome wee ought to beleeue, the more harde, the more we are to ſtirre vp our ſelues, vnles we make ſmall recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſaluation of our ſoules. Hee that ſhall yeeld &amp; giue ouer the digging vp of theſe thornes, becauſe hee perceiueth they grow deepe in his heart, and ſpring as faſt as he can cut them: is not worthie to enter into life: he which will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually till and weede this ground, may well haue the Goſpell in ſome ſorte for to grow in him, but not to ſaue him Dearely beloued we muſt be ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of this, that as there be many godly men, ſo they haue attained it with great labour and toile, yea, they are ſtill ſet a worke &amp; cannot come to an ende, becauſe theſe thornes cannot be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted out.</p>
            <p>Thoſe are greatly ouerſeene which thinke it to be an eaſie thing to profeſſe Chriſt vnto ſaluation: and make no further account but to bee Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21168:14"/>at eaſe: if they can vanquiſh in diſputation, to thinke they haue wonne the fielde: no, no, they haue a heart, which is harde to ouercome: they haue thornes which will not eaſely be deſtroyed: here lieth the victorie and getting of the ſpurs: this man ſhall be crowned becauſe hee hath willingly giuen vp himſelfe to the power of Gods grace to purge his heart, and to make roome for the holy worde, that it may grow there alone, and not bee ouerſhadowed and choaked.</p>
            <p>Now let vs marke well that which is ſaide here, both of the ſtonie and alſo of the thornie grounde; how farre they proceede in profeſſing Chriſt, and imbracing his Goſpell: and we ſhall plainely ſee, how greatly thoſe carnall Goſpellers which will not haue Faith to be tryed by the fruites, are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: Faith, faith, (ſay they) is that which doth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, it is true indeede, but not a fruitleſſe faith: whoſoeuer beleeueth ſhall be ſaued: it is euen ſo, but not after euery kinde of beleefe: for then why ſhould not theſe two ſorts of hearers be ſaued? It is marueilons when the Scripture is ſo euident, and our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh ſo plainely, that this groſſe and doltiſh error ſhould poſſeſſe the minds of ſo many. But indeede it is a ſweete doctrine, when a man may let looſe the raines to all the luſts of the fleſh, at the leaſt thus farre, not to vexe and torment himſelfe in ſubduing them, and yet by faith to be ſaued. When Heauen and Hell meete together, and God and the diuell be reconciled, then ſhal theſe fleſh lie Epicures, and vaine proude
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21168:15"/>men come to their happineſſe. When Chriſt ſhall denye that which hee hath here vttered, then ſhall theſe be true beleeuers.</p>
            <p>Let men therfore take heed that they be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, nor made ſlacke in looking to the fruites of their faith and mortification of vaine fleſhly luſts, through the prophane pratling of ſuch worldly bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods: beleeue not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but beleeue Ieſus Chriſt, who telleth you that it is not enough to heare the word, &amp; to receiue it with ioy, &amp; to let it grow in vs, vnles it bring forth reaſonable &amp; timely fruit in vs.</p>
            <p>Againe, let vs marke how ſtrong and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Argument may be gathered out of this text againſt all contemners and deſpiſers of the word, ſuch as care not for hearing: theſe three ſortes of hearers are before them, and neerer to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then they, &amp; yet come ſhort: therefore it muſt needes follow, that ſuch ignorant Atheiſtes, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowe, nor deſire to knowe any thing aboue this world, are very farre from God, although they would ſeeme with their mouth and lippes to draw neere vnto him. For if this matter were well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, men would not regard nor haue thoſe men in eſtimation to be good and honeſt, who are very dogs or ſwine, not regarding the precious pearle of the Goſpel, but ready to barke and bite at thoſe which bring it. Let a man inquire thus, not of a few, but of the greateſt part of men, how ſay ye to ſuch a man, what thinke ye of him? he is (ſay they) a very good man, a good natured man, a gentle perſon, truſty to his friend, ſure of his word, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21168:15"/>doth keepe as good an houſe as any man of his calling in all this ſhire. But how is he affected vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods word: is he zealous in religion? Nay ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I did neuer heare that he did deale that way, he is a very quiet man, no medler at all. O notable honeſt man, as deuout in the lawes of God as the horſe which hee rideth vpon, as carefull to haue Gods glorie aduaunced, as the ſwine in the ſtie, a great deale behinde theſe vnprofitable hearers, which are caſtawaies: and yet forſooth being very bruit beaſtes before God (in the ſtate they bee in yet, vnleſſe the Lord call them to be zealous of his glorie) they muſt bee reputed for the beſt men. Our fieldes are full of ſuch cattell as theſe, &amp; if the Lord doe not put to his helping hand, our caſe is very miſerable. If any of thoſe which were ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to heare, that they would to their hinderance in worldly matters leaue on their buſineſſe, &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe preaching, as theſe which flocked to heare Chriſt, were yet neuertheles reiected, becauſe they did not ſincerely as they ſhould: what ſhal we ſay of thoſe which will not ſtep out at their doores, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when they haue nothing to doe, vnles it be to ſit at cards or tables? If ſuch a man may bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as is moued with ſome delight, when he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the worde preached: what ſhall we iudge of thoſe woodden blockes &amp; ſottiſh men, who feele no more ioy in it then a poſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is vttered vnto them? If there be ſome goe to deſtruction, which conforme themſelues &amp; haue a ſhew of fruite by the worde: where ſhall thoſe wretches appeare,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21168:16"/>whom the holie word of God cannot mooue one whit, to reforme their diſordered and beaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours. Ineede not ſtand to inueigh out of this place againſt thoſe helliſh helhounds, which dare open their mouthes to reproch and ſlander the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the Goſpell. The Lord diminiſh the number of them.</p>
            <p>The laſt kind of ground, are the good hearers, which do not onlie receiue the ſeed, but alſo bring foorth the fruites thereof. Although not euery one alike or in the ſame meaſure, for ſome bring forth an hundreth folde, ſome ſixtie folde, ſome thirtie folde, according to the meaſure of Gods graces in them.</p>
            <p>Although heer be great ods in bringing foorth the fruites yet they be all accepted and accounted for good ground, true Chriſtians, and ſincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Godlineſſe: now as we be taught heere that it is required of all to be doers, as Saint Iames ſaith, and not hearers only, chap. 1. ver. 22. ſo are we alſo taught, not to deſpiſe or raſhlie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe, which doe not bring foorth ſo great a meaſure of fruit as others do: True it is, as Chriſt ſaith, herein is my Father glorified, that yee bring foorth much fruit. Ioh. 15.8. But it is alſo as true which he ſaith in the ſeconde verſe of the ſame chapter, <hi>Euery branch that bringeth foorth fruit, he purgeth, that it may bring foorth more fruite.</hi> Then to bring foorth moſt, is moſt of all to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that God may haue the greateſt glorie: to bring forth the leaſt is not to bee contemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21168:16"/>the Lord in time doth purge them, &amp; make them more fruitfull. I need not to ſtand heere for to handle many things, or to make large expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the matter is exceeding plain, there is no more but this, that all our care in hearing and profeſſing the Goſpell, bee to receiue it into good ground, &amp; to bring forth the fruites thereof. What ſhould I ſtand to rip vp the ſhamefull abuſe in the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to vtter how manie euill fruits there be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie which are Goſpellers. This ſhould be but as it were to light a candle in the cleare Sunſhine, for all men doe ſee them. I doe not ſpeake this, as though it ſhould not bee good to cry out againſt them: but becauſe the former things which I haue now vttered, doe fully diſcloſe them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will heere ende, deſiring the Lord to write theſe things in our hearts, which wee haue heard with our outwarde eares, and to make vs good ground, to receiue the heauenly ſeed, and to bring forth fruits of the ſame, that glorifying him in this world, we may be glorifyed of him in the world to come, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Leſſed Peter an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1</note> wrote this Epiſtle to the Chriſtian Iewes which dwelt as ſtrangers diſperſed here and there in ſundrie countries, as in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bithynia. For the ten tribes were ſcattered of old time, and had dwelt long among the Gentiles in many kingdoms, being caried away by Shalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſer king of Aſhur, out of their owne lande, as wee read 2. King. 17. And of ſomewhat later times manie of the tribe of Iuda and Beniamin
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21168:18"/>were alſo diſperſed among the heathen: ſo that S. Iames wrothis epiſtle in like maner to the twelue tribes which were in the diſperſion, Iames 1. ver. 1. Theſe diſperſed Iewes came vp out of all landes at certaine ſolemne feaſtes, vnto Ieruſalem for to worſhip there according to the law of Moſes, and there had they heard the Apoſtles preach Chriſt, as ye may ſee by that which is written Act. 2. and beleeued in him: and vnto them that ſo beleeued S. Iames and S. Peter directed their Epiſtles. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the matters handled in this Epiſtle of Peter, we are to note that the holy Apoſtle dealeth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie about the duties of chriſtian life: as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the times being then full of troubles and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of perſecutions, hee laboureth to make them bolde, patient, conſtant and cheerefull in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and ſufferinges, which they were to paſſe through to come to the partaking of the heauenly glory with Chriſt. Alſo hee vſeth manie graue and forcible reaſons to mooue them vnto true holineſſe, euen to walke in the vertues of the ſpirit of grace, and to bring foorth fruites worthie of ſo high a calling. But firſt of all he openeth as it were the fountaine and beginning of all good actions in man, that is, how God of his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie had choſen them, and begotten them in Chriſt to bee his children and heires of glory. Among theſe perſwaſions, admonitions, and exhortations of the Apoſtle, this is one which I haue read vnto you, and which I am now to handle. It may bee diuided into three partes: Of which the firſt is an
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21168:18"/>admonition, or an exhortation, wherby he ſtirreth vp all the faithfull vnto ſobriety and watchfulnes, in theſe wordes, <hi>Be ſober and watch.</hi> The ſecond part ſheweth what cauſe there is to moue all men vnto this ſobriety and watchfulnes, or how much it ſtandeth them euery way vpon, ſeeing they haue ſo terrible and ſo cruell an aduerſary, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie ſeeketh their eternall woe and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which is in theſe wordes: <hi>For your aduerſarie the diuell, as a roaring Lion walketh about, ſeeking whom hee may deuoure.</hi> The thirde and laſt parte doth teach howe wee ſhall withſtand him, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him, and put him to flight, that ſo wee may eſcape from his cruell tyranny: which is in theſe words, <hi>Whom reſist ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> All men may eaſilie ſee, that the matter which wee haue here to deale in, is of the greateſt moment. If a man haue landes or goods, and perceiue that he hath an aduerſary which lyeth in wait, and ſeeketh to depriue him of the ſame, it will mooue him to take heed, and it wil ſet him on worke, to ſeeke all the wayes and meanes hee can to learne how hee may defend and hold his right. If a man do knowe that his enemie doth continuallie ſeeke all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie and all occaſions howe hee may ſet vpon him vnawares, and with the greateſt aduantages be can, to take away his life: will he not watch and take heed? yea will he not bee glad to learne how he may ſo arme and ſtrengthen himſelfe that hee may withſtand his ſaide cruell enemie when hee commeth? Here is a farre greater matter, not the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21168:19"/>loſſe of goods or landes, or of this fraile life, but the deſtruction of both body and ſoule in eternall damnation, which is ſought by a very mightie, ſubtill and cruell enemie. I know therefore that ſo many as haue any ſparke of true wiſedom, wil be very attentiue to hearken to this exhortation of the Apoſtle, and willing to learne how they may be kept ſafe from ſo great a danger. For how foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a thing is it, that we ſhould bee ſo carefull to beware of men, that they may not harm vs, which is but in lighter matters, &amp; in the mean time haue no regard how to beware of diuels, which ſeek our eternal wo and miſerie? Hearken therfore (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) vnto this wholſome inſtruction: for nowe will I come to handle euery member by it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be ſober and watch.</hi> Watching to this end that we may keep our ſelues out of danger, is the chiefe and principall matter of this exhortation: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man can bee fit to watch vnleſſe hee bee ſober, hee ioyneth them both together, and ſaith vnto vs, <hi>Be ſober and watch.</hi> It is in vaine to call vpon drunken men to watch, for ſleep will ſoone oppreſſe them: hee that is ſober, hee may watch: <hi>Be ſober therefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and watch.</hi> For our further inſtruction in this point, wee are to remember, that there bee two kindes of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, two kindes of ſoberneſſe, two ſortes of ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and two ſorts of watching, the one of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the other of the minde. Hee that with exceſſe and ryote powreth in wine and ſtrong drinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he be drunken, his ſenſes are then oppreſſed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21168:19"/>drowſineſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vpon him, and he falleth into a ſound ſleep, his aduerſary may come vpon him and doe vnto him what he will: this we all knowe to be true. He that keepeth himſelfe in ſobrietie, &amp; is not ouercome with wine or ſtrong drink, but vſeth them moderately, he can, if need bee, watch for to eſchue and withſtand perilles and dangers. Now as the bodie is made drunken with wine, or ſtrong drinke, ſo is the mind oppreſſed and made drunken with earthly cares, with carnal pleaſures, with euil luſtes and vaine delightes, which bring a drowſineſſe vpon it and a dead ſleepe, ſo that the ſpirituall enemie may come vnto it at pleaſure to doe what he will. On the contrary part hee that keepeth his mind ſober touching thoſe cares and pleaſures, ſo that hee is not oppreſſed nor drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, he can watch, to auoyd the ſpirituall dangers. This then is the thing which Saint Peter doth exhort vnto, that we caſt out cares and vain pleaſures out of our minde, that they make it not drunken, and caſt it into a ſleepe, and ſo into extreame perill, but that it may continue ſober and fit to watch againſt all ſpirituall dangers. Our Sauiour Chriſt doth teach that the heauenly ſeed is choked with cares &amp; pleaſures of this life; Luk. 8 verſe 14. And if any ſhall now demaunde, Doth S. Peter exhort here only vnto that ſobrietie of the mind? or is it his purpoſe to exhort vnto ſobrietie in drinking alſo, together with that other? I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that he requireth both: in as much as a man cannot haue a ſober and watchfull minde which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21168:20"/>doth follow the drunkenneſſe of the body. For ſuch as be giuen to gluttony and drunkenneſſe, or to take pleaſure in pampering the fleſh, their minde is drowned in all luſtes and carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and then cares doe alſo enter, how they may prouide for the filling of thoſe inſatiable luſtes: and ſo their minde is alſo drunken and in a deade ſleep, ſo that they cannot watch for to eſchew any ſpirituall danger. This is the extreame miſerie of ſuch as doe flowe in vaine delightes, that they bee drunken and aſleepe, the diuell may put into them almoſt what he liſt. And therefore our Sauiour Chriſt warning his diſciples to watch for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to iudgment, willeth them firſt to beware leaſt at any time their hearts ſhould be oppreſſed with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and with the cares of this life, and ſo that day ſhould come ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly vpon them, Luke 21. verſ. 34.36. Where we ſee plainlie that our Sauiour ioyneth both the bodilie drunkenneſſe, and the drunkenneſſe of the mind together, as making men vtterly vnfit to watch. Then beloued, let vs giue good heed, and follow this wholſome counſell which the holie Ghoſt doth here giue vnto vs by this Apoſtle. If we watch not, we are vtterly vndone, we are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſt away, as it ſhall appeare by the next words. We cannot watch vnleſſe wee keepe our mindes from the drunkenneſſe of cares and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pleaſures, and our bodies from exceſſe of wine and ſtrong drink, and continue them ſober. And thus much touching the firſt part.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:21168:20"/>
               <p>Now to the ſecond: <hi>For your aduerſary the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, &amp;c.</hi> If we be not ſenſeleſſe, &amp; voyd of all care, yea euen as ſtones almoſt or blockes, if we be not like mad men, this may mooue vs vnto all ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and watchſulneſſe of minde, here is ſo fearfull and ſo horrible a danger ſet before vs, if we do not watch, namelie, that our cruell enemie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſeeketh about continually, and lieth in waite greedilie to deuoure our ſoules, yea euen to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vs vp vnto eternall damnation in hell. Is it a light matter (beloued) to be deuoured of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell? Is it nothing to goe to hell? we are ſure to fall into his handes, wee are ſure to bee deuoured and ſwallowed vp into the wofull gulfe of hell, if wee doe not learne to be ſober and to watch, and ſo to auoyd him: for if we be drunken and ſo aſleep in mind, he commeth vpon vs, and there is no helpe nor any way to eſcape him. Behold here, what the cares and pleaſures of the fleſh do bring men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that is to ſay, they cannot watch, but their mind is drowned and caſt into a deepe ſleepe, ſo that the diuell commeth vpon them, and taketh them as a praie, ſwalloweth them vp vnto eternall captiuitie. But there is great force in euerie worde to expreſſe vnto vs this danger, and therfore I will handle them particularlie. <hi>Your aduerſarie.</hi> Saint Peter propoundeth vnto vs an aduerſarie: and what doe men looke for at the handes of a deadly aduerſarie, but all the harme and miſchiefe that he can worke them, and therefore each man hath an cie to his aduerſarie, to beware of him, that hee
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21168:21"/>catch him not at any aduantage. Now this aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie which is here propounded doth ſo burne in extreame hatred and malice againſt God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all mankind, that it is giuen vnto him as a proper name: for in the Hebrue tongue he is called <hi>Satan,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, an aduerſarie. For he is the aduerſarie, as I may ſay; of adderſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or the chiefe of all other. There is no way of reconciliation to be ſought with him, there is no truce to bee made, nor yet any mitigation of his cruell furie to be looked for, but we may be ſure of all the miſchiefe and harme that hee can any way doe vnto vs make full account of that. There is no pittie of mercie with him, neither is he any way to be truſted, for he is alyar, he is a deceiuer, hee is a Diuell. <hi>Your aduerſary the diuell.</hi> As hee is called <hi>Satan</hi> in the Hebrew tongue, ſo is he in the Greek tongue called <hi>Diabolos,</hi> which we call <hi>Diuell,</hi> it is as much as to ſay, one that doth accuſe, one that with cauillation doth depraue &amp; lay crime. Look what is beſt done, that doth diſpleaſe him moſt: he is nothing but falſhood and lies: as I ſaid, heere is no truſting, here is no way or hope of mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his cruell rage. But it may bee obiected, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multitudes of nations and people vpon the earthare ſo many, how can one Diuell put all in danger? for Saint Peter ſpeaketh as it were but of one Diuell. While he is in one countrie, he cannot be in another, and while hee is dealing with one man, another then goeth free. For anſwere vnto this, we are to vnderſtand, that S. Peter ſpeaketh
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21168:21"/>as of one diuell, not becauſe he is but one: for the holie ſcriptures do teach that there be multitudes, and as it were Armies of Diuels which doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe vs about, ſeeking our vtter deſtruction; wee reade in the Goſpell of a legion of Diuelles which did poſſeſſe one man; as it is ſayd, they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: But S. Peter heere ſpeaketh as of one, becauſe there is but one kingdome of Satan, &amp; one prince of darkneſſe, that kingdome is not diuided, Satan is not diuided againſt Satan, as our Sauiour tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, Mat. 12. They doe all deale in one buſines, one doth not enuy another, one doth not hinder or let another, but further what they can: and ſo they ioyne all together, as if they were all but one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. The bond which doth tie them togither in this conſent, is that cruell malice and hatred where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they burn both againſt God &amp; man. So God may bee diſhonored and blaſphemed it pleaſeth them by whomſoeuer it be done: ſo men may bee brought to damnation, they care not which of them preuaile moſt. If one of them doe as it were halfe preuaile to caſt downe a man to perdition, and another do finiſh it vp, they contend not who hath done moſt. There needeth no praiſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation in that kingdome to pricke any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; neither any threatning to the negligent: all are caried with a vehement heat to do their vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. There is no manfree then from the aſſaults and temptations of Diuels: they ſeeke to deuoure euery ſoule. Let no man imagine that hee can bee drunken in minde, and ſo lie aſleepe; and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21168:22"/>yet be free from danger: He that will eſcape muſt be ſober, and watch, for a multitude of Diuelles compaſſe vs about. It is ſayd further, <hi>As a roring Lyon.</hi> We are very faſt aſleep if this roaring can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not awake vs, and cauſe vs to be ſober and watch, eſpeciallie if we conſider why he is ſaid to roare. It is written Pſal. 104. verſ. 21. <hi>The Lyons roaring after their praie, doe ſeeke their meate at God.</hi> Wherby it doth appeare that the Lyons being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hungrie and greedy, they roare after their praie: and therfore to expreſſe how greedily Satan doth hunt after the ſoules of men, how hungry he is for to deuour them, he is likened vnto a roaring Lyon which ſeeketh his praie. This compariſon ſheweth that hee is verie terrible, for a Lyon is a mighty beaſt, and being ſo hungrie and greedie that hee roareth for the praie, it much increaſeth the terror. The diuel then is here ſet forth vnto vs to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in as much as he is likened to a Lyon, and verie hungry &amp; greedy in deuouring the ſoules of men, in that he is likened to a roaring Lyon. Who then that is wiſe wil make himſelf dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ken in mind with cares and pleaſures, and lie ſleeping when ſuch a terrible enemie ſeeketh to deuour him? And now it may be demaunded, what is the cauſe that the holy Ghoſt doth ſet him foorth vnto vs to bee ſo mighty and ſo terrible? the cauſe is manifeſt, wee are ſecure, we are negligent, we are ready to ſleep, our minds are ouerwhelmed and drowned in all luſtes and carnall pleaſures, as if there were no danger at all: ſuch is our extreame madneſſe.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21168:22"/>And that is the cauſe why the Scripture in other places alſo deſcribeth the diuell to bee ſo horrible. Saint Paule calleth the Diuels Empires and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the rulers of the darkneſſe of this worlde, and ſpiritual wickednes in the high places. And ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Diuelles haue their fierie dartes with which they ſeek to pearce through &amp; ſlay the fouls of men. Ephe. 6. ver. 12.16. What a dreadful mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is he ſet foorth to be Reu. 12. Hee is not only likened to a drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo a moſt huge gret one, yea ſo mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous great, that he caſteth forth a floud of waters out of his mouth, &amp; his tail caſteth down the third part of the ſtars of heauen. He is not only a moſt monſtrous great Dragon, but alſo fiery red, burning with hatred, with crueltie, &amp; blood. Full of deep ſubtilties, for he hath ſeuen heads. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mighty, as hauing ten homes. One that hath as a victorious Prince often conquered the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, for he hath ſeuen crownes. What a terror is ſet foorth in all theſe, a hungrie roaring Lyon, mightie powers with fierie dartes, a moſt monſtrous fierce Dragon, full of ſubtiltie, crueltie, and power? Is heer any place to be drunken and to ſleepe? doth it not ſtand vs vpon to be ſober and to watch? vnleſſe we account it a ſmall matter to fall as a praie into the pawes of this roaring Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to haue our ſoules pearced through &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death with his fierie dartes, and to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp into the bellie of this Dragon, and with him to be caſt into the lake of fire, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death. Reuel. 20. ver. 14. O beloued, let vs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21168:23"/>not be ſo dull hearted, when the Lord doth warne vs of ſuch an aduerſary, as to make no reckoning, but be as careleſſe, as if wee had no enemie at all that ſought our woe. Men in deed doe naturally feare and tremble at any ſignes of the preſence of diuels; if he ſhew himſelfe in any vgly forme, they be terrified: and yet neuertheleſſe moſt careleſlie make their owne mindes drunken with cares and carnall pleaſures falling into a dead ſleepe, ſo that he vtterly ſpoyleth them, and woundeth them to death, and they feele it not. This is euen the courſe almoſt of the whole worlde. O lamentable and wretched eſtate! who can bewaile it ſufficientlie? Howe many thouſand thouſandes haue drunke themſelnes ſtarke drunken with the delightes of this world, and as merrie as they bee, are by this roaring I on deuoured as a praie, and ſwallowed vp by the Dragon? Drunken perſons, eſpeciallie when they be fallen into a deep ſleep, haue no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance of their miſeries: Bee they in debt, or condemned to death, they feele it not, but can laugh: and ſo playeth the drunken world. O how neceſſarie a thing is it then that we bee ſober and watch, to the end that we may eſcape ſuch daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? But it is added further that this aduerſarie goeth about ſeeking whom he may deuour. This doth much yet further increaſe the perill, &amp; ought ſo much the rather to mooue vs vnto a moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſobrietie and watchfulneſſe: this aduerſarie doth continuallie ſeeke all occaſions, and lieth in waite to eſpie all aduantages, how he may deuour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21168:23"/>vs as his praie. If a man haue a ſtrong aduerſarie, and one that hateth him ſo deadly, that if he could catch him he would take away his life: and the ſame his aduerſarie be a farre off in another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and doth not lie in wayte for him, hee may be the more ſecure, hee may ſleepe quietlie. But if hee bee alwayes at hand, and doe in all places dogge him, to eſpie his fit opportunitie to doe him miſchiefe, doth it not ſtand him vpon, if hee make any account of his owne life, to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſober and watchfull? ſhall he drinke himſelfe drunken and lie downe to ſleepe? The Diuel our aduerſarie goeth about, hee is euer at hand, hee ſeeketh all occaſions how he may deuour vs, is it now ſafe for vs to ſleepe? Men when they ſeeke about and trauell, doe waxe weary, and muſt haue times to eate, and to take their reſt: it is not ſo with the Diuell, hee is very ſwift, hee is neuer weary, hee needeth no foode, nor yet any ſleepe, hee ceaſeth not day nor night for to worke our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. When wee trauell on the day hee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs, when wee lie vpon our beds in the night he dealeth with vs, there is no time that we can be free from him. If hee cannot preuaile at one time, he wayteth for another: if hee cannot ouercome a man in one ſinne, hee trieth him in another: and moſt carefullie he watcheth his fit occaſions, and then he tempteth ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>To bring a man vnto drunkennes, riot, &amp; exceſſe and to ſpend his time in vaine exerciſes, he hath his inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, euen riotous perſons, which are wholy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21168:24"/>giuen that way, for to draw and to perſwade. Wo be to that man which lighteth into the familiarity of ſuch ſinners that will ſo allure and intiſe him. What a wonderfull force there is in companie for to drawe men vnto euill, cannot almoſt bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: and therefore when Satan hath founde ſuch inſtruments for to ſet vpon a man, hee hath gotten great aduantage. When a man is in place where he may ſecretly commit ſome foule ſinne, as theft or adultery, and the occaſions offred, then Satan layeth in hard. And ſo is it in other ſinnes. What ſhould I enter into particulars, ſeeing hee hath a thouſand wayes, a thouſand occaſions, yea ten thouſande ſleightes and crafty meanes for to winde in himſelfe. Alas what ſhall we doe? Our Sauiour ſaith, Watch and pray leaſt ye enter into temptation. Mat, 26. verſ. 41. And as hee ſaide to Peter, <hi>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath deſired to ſift you as wheat,</hi> Luk. 22.31. ſo let vs al be aſſured, that he hath many wayes to ſift vs, and to make triall what is in vs. We are taught to pray, <hi>Lead vs not into temptation:</hi> and this place doth ſhew how neceſſarie a prayer it is: for if the Lord giue ſcope to this enemie and leaue vs to our ſelues, hee will find a thouſand meanes vtterly to ſpoyle vs: hee wil euen deuour vs as his praie, and wee ſhall not perceiue it, for there in lieth the greateſt daunger, that he blindeth the eies of the minde, and harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the heart, when men feele not his working, nor imagine any ſuchthing. Hee that is ſober and doth watch, feeleth when he ſetteth vpon him, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21168:24"/>what harme he doth vnto him: where as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, he may doe what he will vnto thoſe that are drunken and aſleep, and they know it not. Thus much touching the ſecond part: now let vs come to the third and laſt part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom reſist ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> If a mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie be too ſtrong for him by many degrees, what is he the better that he watcheth, if hee can not auoide but that he will find him &amp; come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? will he not kill him for all his watching? The like obiection may heere be made, namely, that the power of Diuels far exceedeth all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of man: as we ſee they be deſcribed to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and terrible: and there is no way for a man to hide himſelfe from them, but they finde him out, and come vpon him: what is hee then the better that he doth watch? Saint Peter doth anſwere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this: that although in our own ſtrength we are nothing to this mightie roaring Lyon, yet there is a power in which we ſhall reſiſt him, put him to flight, and ouercome him, and be armed againſt al harmes: and that is the power offaith: <hi>Whome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> Let it not ſeeme ſtrange vnto any, that this power ſhould reſiſt him, and keep vs in ſafetie, for it is the power of God. The Diuell is ſtrong and mightie, but what is he vnto God? God is aboue all, his power is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, there is no power that can ſtand againſt it. He that is ſtedfaſt in the faith, hee is armed and ſtandeth in the power of God: for faith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the power of God and armeth vs with it. He
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21168:25"/>that ſtandeth in the faith, ſtandeth as it were in God, compaſſed about and couered with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And as it is vnpoſſible that Sathan ſhoulde preuaile againſt the power of God, ſo is it vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he ſhould ouerthrowe that man which ſtandeth ſtedfaſt in the faith: for ſo long as God cannot be ouercome, faith cannot be ouercome. Is not heere a moſt ſingular comfort and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto vs in this battaile? Let the Diuell be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo mightie, neuer ſo ſubtill, fierce and raging, we haue a rock of defence, a ſafe tower to fly vnto eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the inuincible power of almighty God, which we ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d armed withal throghfaith. This is it which S. Paule teacheth where he ſpeaketh of the battell which we haue with the diuel: <hi>My brethren</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in his mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Put on the whole armour of God, that you may ſtand against the aſſaults of the Diuel. For we wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle not againſt bloud and fleſh, but againſt rulers, againſt powers, &amp;c. Therefore take vnto you the whole armour of God that yee may bee able to reſiſt in the euill day, &amp; haning finiſhed all things, ſtand. Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.11.12.13. Now it is faith that putteth vpon vs the whole armour of God, and maketh vs ſtrong in his mighty power. It is faith, as he ſheweth in the ſame place, by which we ſhal quench all the fiery dartes of the diuell. Likewiſe S. Iohn ſetteth foorth this matter, ſaying, <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is borne of God ouercommeth the world: &amp; this is the victorie that ouercommeth the worlde, euen our faith, Who is it that ouercommeth the worlds,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21168:25"/>but he that beleeueth that Ieſus is the ſon of God?</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.5.6. By the world he meaneth the whole corruption of ſin, or whatſoeuer is againſt the commandementes of God, and ſo the Diuell the Prince of the world is included. He that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the world, ouercommeth the prince of the world: for all the power of Satans kingdome is in darkneſſe and in ſin. Then when Saint Iohn ſaith that faith is our victorie, and that by it we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the world, he teacheth that it is faith by which wee are armed with the power of God, in which we ſtand ſafe, and ouercome the Diuell.</p>
               <p>Heerby it is manifeſt what a woonderfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing faith is. There is no force that can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, he that hath obtained it cannot be poore, he cannot be vnhappy or wretched: all the diuels in hel cannot preuail againſt him. <hi>They thatt ruſt in the Lord are as mount the Sion, which cannot be mooued, but ſtandeth faſt for euer.</hi> Pſalm. 125. verſ. 1 If it be then the moſt excellent thing that is, to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the faith: then are we aboue all other things to ſeeke after it For wiſdome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to ſeeke moſt for the beſt thinges. Golde, pearle, and precious ſtones doe excell in price, and therefore they be greatly ſought after: and men do much reioice when they finde them. They bee more then droſſe being compared with faith, by which we put diuels to flight, and obtaine eternall glory. Shall wee not then ſeeke for faith? Shall we not make account that if we find it we haue found all for what can a man haue more then God? And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21168:26"/>if we miſſe of it we haue loſt all: ſeeing without it nothing can defende vs from the aſſaultes of the Diuell.</p>
               <p>But when we are willed to reſiſt the Diuel ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the faith, is it ſo that wee haue faith in our owne power, or when wee will? Can wee of our ſelues be ſtedfaſt in faith? Or is it a matter ſo eaſie to obtaine a ſtrong faith? Saint Peter hath no ſuch meaning. For goodly thinges are hard to be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto: and faith is the moſt precious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all other, &amp; moſt hard to be come by. It is not in mans will or power to beleeue and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſtedfaſtlie at his pleaſure. But Saint Peters meaning is, to mooue all men to feeke it where it is to be found, and by ſuch meanes as be orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for to come vnto it by. For there is no man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt but will acknowledge that a ſtrong faith is a moſt rich iewell: but when it commeth to the matter they depriue themſelues for the moſt part, either deeming that they haue it or can haue it in their owne power reſting in a vaine ſhadowe, not knowing at all the nature of the true, liuely, and powerfull faith: or if they doe acknowledge it to be the gift of God; yet they neuer ſeeke it by thoſe meanes which he hath ordained to worke it in men, and to nouriſh it vp in them. When wee are therefore willed to reſiſt the Diuell ſtedfaſt in the faith, it is as much as to ſaye, giue all diligence, and vſe all the wayes and meanes that may be to increaſe and ſtrengthen your faith, that you may ouercome the Diuell. If you be diligent that way,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21168:26"/>happie are you, and if you take not that courſe, then are you vtterly vndone: for what way can you then eſcape the power and tyranny of the roaring Lyon?</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid, S. Peter doth not heere ſhewe how men ſhall come to this ſtedfaſt faith. No, for his whole doctrine tendeth to that point, in al this Epiſtle, and therefore hee needed not to put them in mind particularlie: yet it ſhall not be amiſſe for me to note ſomewhat.</p>
               <p>He that will attaine to the true, liuelie, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith, which armeth a man with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, muſt firſt of all know for certainty, that he hath not ſo much as anie ſpark thereof of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: we are all of vs by nature ſhut vp vnder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe, and in miſerable blindneſſe: which while many doe not know, they reſt and content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in a certaine dead image of faith, and are vtterlie ſeduced, for that faith hath no power. He that knoweth this indeed, beholding the depth of the calamities which hee is in, will looke vp to God who is the giuer of faith. Hee is deſirous to know what the promiſes of God are which hee is to beleeue, and what the way is in which hee muſt walke to performe the duties of a Chriſtian life: for the true faith worketh by charitie (as Paule ſaith) and cannot be without good workes. He ſearcheth the Scriptures (as Chriſt willeth, Ioh. 5.) hee doth with all diligence bende his eare to heare the holy Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt preached, feeling therein the power of God to worke faith.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21168:27"/>He doth crie and cal vnto God day &amp; night for to teach him, to lighten him, to giue him vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; to increaſe his faith: He findeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſing of God in theſe meanes, &amp; therefore applieth them. But now on the contrary part, hee that reſteth in this, God giueth faith, and if it be his will. I ſhall haue it, and ſo deſpiſeth all meanes, not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how God giueth faith, is vtterlie awrie, and out of the right way. From hence it is that there be ſo manie commendations of the word of God, and of the liuelie power that it hath to ſaue our ſoules. From hence it is that wee are often called vpon to giue eare to the voice of God, to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his counſels.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhall wee obtaine the holy faith. And he that hath faith, and feeleth the power of God in him, if he will haue it increaſe, is to conſider the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant kindnes of God who hath beſtowed ſo great a gift vpon him, he is from the bottom of his heart to giue all praiſe and thankes and honor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for ſo great kindneſſe and mercie ſhewed. Moreouer, he is to take heed that wil be ſtedfaſt in the faith to reſiſt the diuel, that he bee rich in good workes, and that hee abſtaine from committing thoſe vices which nature doth lead vnto. For in the time of triall, in the hower of temptation, or when Satan doth aſſault, it will greatly ſhake the mind, if a man when he doth looke for the arguments of a true faith, and findeth that hee hath beene fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: but if his conſcience doe accuſe him not only of a ſlackneſſe in good workes, but alſo of foule
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21168:27"/>ſinnes commited, then will he crie out that all his former profeſſion of the faith was but in ſhew or in hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>This Apoſtle in the firſt chapter of his ſeconde Epiſtle teacheth, that if we ioyne vertue with our faith, and with vertue knowledge, and with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge temperance, &amp; with temperance patience, and with patience godlineſſe, and with godlineſſe brotherlie kindnes, and with brotherlie kindneſſe loue: we ſhal make our calling and election ſure, we ſhall if we doe theſe thinges (as he ſaith) neuer fall. 2. Pet 1. verſ. 5.6.10. We ſhall perceiue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly if theſe things be in vs, that God hath called vs effectually, and that hee hath choſen vs. And therein doth conſiſt the ſtedfaſtnes of faith, euen when we are ſure that God hath choſen vs in his ſonne vnto life eternall. If this aſſurance of Gods loue and fauour towards vs were not to be attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto, how could he ſay, <hi>Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith?</hi> Can there be any ſtedfaſt faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that? I beſeech yee let vs thinke well of theſe things: let vs vſe all care and diligence, yea all the holy meanes that God hath appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our faith, that being armed therby, we may reſiſt and ouercome our enemie the diuell.</p>
               <p>But here it may be demaunded, whether the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell be to be reſiſted only by faith, or ſome other things to be vſed? I anſwere, that Saint Peter doth ſet downe the only way by which we are to reſiſt the diuell: we haue nothing whereby to withſtand him but faith: and that is ſufficient alone to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21168:28"/>him, whatſoeuer way hee ſeeketh to hurt vs. I ſuppoſe that the reaſon heerof is euident vnto all men. The power of God alone is ſufficient (euery man will confeſſe) to ſhielde vs from the Diuell, and no power indeed but the power of God. Faith onely armeth vs with that power of God, and maketh it as it were ours. He that ſtandeth and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth (as the the Scripture ſpeaketh) by faith, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and liueth not in himſelfe, but in the power of God. If we thinke it lawfull to ſeeke help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, and to put him to flight any where but in God, then may we vſe ſome other way to reſiſt him beſides faith. We are to reſiſt him by praier, will ſome ſay. That is true, for prayer is a ſpeciall fruite of faith: the liuely faith doth bring foorth true prayer. And if the prayer bee not of faith, it cannot help to deliuer vs from the tyranny of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Faith ſendeth vp praier, yea with faſting ſtrong praier, which draweth downe the power of God vpon vs, which ſhieldeth and defendeth vs from the rage of the fiende. All other meanes that haue beene deuiſed to put diuels to flight, are vaine and friuolous, yea meere illuſions of Satans owne deuiſing, which wickedlie deface the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. For when men cannot reſiſt by faith, then doe they flie vnto thoſe other meanes as more ſure. Wofull is the ſtate of the world in this thing: that when men wil not learne of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the diuell: they learne at the diuell himſelfe. But that this thing may be more euident, we are to ſee how many wayes the diuell ſeeketh to deuour vs.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21168:28"/>I doe not meane that we ſhould in particulars ſee thoſe wayes by which the Diuell deuoureth the ſoules of men: for who is able ſo to expreſſe them? ſurely not any mortall man. For he hath manifold ſleightes, ſubtilties and craftes: yea euen ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deuiſes of all ſorts to ſnare, and to entrap the ſoules withall: Hee hath alſo his forces and fierie dartes of terrour to wounde withall. It is no dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in particulars: but to bee armed ſtronglie to reſiſt him howſoeuer he commeth. My purpoſe therefore is but to touch certaine generall heads which containe the reſt. So that this cruell aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, this roaring Lyon the Diuell may catch the praie &amp; deuour it, he careth not which way it bee, for that is the ende of all, if hee may carie ſoules to hell. And therefore according to the ſeuerall ſtates and conditions that men bee in, hee frameth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſet vpon them.</p>
               <p>There is no man (I ſuppoſe) which will make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doubt that the diuel coueteth to plunge al men as deep as he can into all euill: but according as men are apt and incliued, he is faine to deale as he may, with ſome one way, with ſome another. Such as be ignorant, &amp; in darkneſſe, with them he dealeth that he may keep the pure, cleere and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie light of the Goſpell out of their harts, &amp; ſo holde them ſtill vnder the power and in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſſe. Touching theſe Saint Paule ſaith, <hi>If our Goſpell be hid, it is hid to thoſe that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: in whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes euen of the infidels, leaſt the light of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21168:29"/>Goſpell of the glorie of Chriſt, ſhoulde ſhine vnto them: which is the image of God.</hi> 2. Cor. 4. verſ. 3.4. To bring this to paſſe this enemie vſeth ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes, by which he may diffame the Goſpel and the profeſſion of it, as a doctrine not to bee ſuffered, breeding and drawing with it ſo manie euils. As namelie, he ſoweth errours, hereſies, and wicked opinions. He is the father of al ſuch things. He raiſeth vp the heretickes and Schiſmatickes, and then ſuggeſteth to the heartes of men, which be his chiefe ſeruants, that the Goſpell hath bred them, and they proclaime it with open mouth. Behold and ſee (ſay they) what a doctrine is this, yea this new learning, that hath brought foorth ſo many foule hereſies and diuiſions. The diuell (ſay they) the diuell goeth with it. How can it be of God? how can it bee good doctrine which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth ſuch fruit?</p>
               <p>Satan did practiſe this while the holie Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were aliue vpon the earth: as we read how the falſe Apoſtles did ſeeke almoſt euerie where to pul down that which S Paule had built. S. Iohn in the Reuelation mentioneth the Nicholaitanes, and a woman which ſaid ſhe was a Propheteſſe, that taught &amp; ſeduced the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Lord, that they might commit fornication, and eat of things offred vnto Idols. And the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, that in his time there were many Antichriſts (for ſo he calleth the heretikes which then were) 1. Ioh. 2. S. Paule ſaid to the Elders of Epheſus. <hi>I knowe this that after my departure there ſhall enter in among
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21168:29"/>you grieuous Wolues, not ſparing the flocke, and there ſhall riſe vp of your ſelues that ſhal ſpeak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe things to draw Diſciples after them.</hi> Act. 20. When all the Apoſtles were taken out of this life, then was this prophecie fully accompliſhed, for then did the diuell ſend foorth euen routs of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heretickes which did ſeduce manie, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie trouble all Churches. Then had hee thoſe which cried out: Beholde what a Goſpell, is this which hath brought foorth ſo foule and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous opinions? Thus cunninglie did Satan work to keepe manie ſtill in their former blindnes. And in like maner in theſe dayes, when the light of the goſpell againe brake foorth, he raiſed vp hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible hereſies and ſectes, and then ſetteth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants a worke to crie out. See what fruits this new Goſpell bringeth forth? This hath made many ſo much offended at it, that they will not heare it: and ſo the Diuell holdeth them ſtill in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer blindneſſe, and deuoureth them as a praie. Alſo hee raiſeth vp lies and ſlaunders to diffame both the doctrine and al that profeſſe it. This hath beene his ancient practiſe. Chriſt was ſaid to haue a diuell, to be a raiſer of ſedition, and an enemie to Ceſar. His Apoſtles were deemed to be raiſers of faction and diſturbers of the common peace, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the ſtate of princes, and the Chriſtians euer were accuſed to be men whichſecretly amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelues did commit moſt foule and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinnes. True it is, that in all times he had manie which were hypocrites that profeſſed the trueth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21168:30"/>for a time and then falling into notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all the profeſſors were ſaid to be ſuch. Thus hath he in all times held many in darkneſſe, by making them out of loue with the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And as when Chriſt was riſen from the dead, Satan did raiſe and ſpread a lie, namely that while the watchmen were aſleep, the diſciples of Chriſt did ſteale him away, and then ſayd he was riſen, and this lie was beleeued (though it were moſt abſurd &amp; had no ſhew of liklihood) ſo looke what lies and ſlaunders he raiſeth vp nowe, manie doe beleeue them. For as S. Paul ſaith 2. Theſſ. 2. <hi>Becauſe men receiue not the loue of the truth, God ſendeth them ſtrong deluſion to beleeue lies.</hi> Nowe for a man to reſiſt the diuell in theſe practiſes, that he be not ſeduced and held in blindnes, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to haue knowledge of the trueth and a liuely faith. For if he come once to that, he ſhal find that the Goſpel is the pure and heauenly light, euen the power of God to ſaluation, as S. Paule ſaith, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that beleeueth. Rom. 1. And that theſe ſectes and hereſies and troubles that follow it, are raiſed vp by the diuell himſelfe, euen of purpoſe to diffame the truth, that ſo men may abhorre to hear it preached. Such as haue receiued the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth and are lightened, in them hee ſeeketh how he may quench the light, or take the power of it out of their harts, and ſo deuoure them as his praie.</p>
               <p>He hath diuers wayes and means to effect this. To ſuch as be the weaker in knowledge, euen as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21168:30"/>babes in vnderſtanding of the heuae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly myſteries, he layeth ſtumbling blockes and offences, that he may cauſe them to ſtumble and fall, or to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide out of the way into which they haue entred. He raiſeth vp terrours, troubles, and perilles to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſh them. He tempteth and leadeth into diſpair, ſhooting his fierie dartes. To auoyde theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, there is no way, but that as S. Paule prayeth for the faithfull at Coloſſa, that we bee filled with the knowledge of the will of God in all wiſdome and ſpirituall vnderſtanding: that we may walke worthie of the Lord in all pleaſing being fruitfull in all good workes, and increaſing in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: ſtrengthened in all might through his glorious power, vnto all patience and long ſuffering with ioyfulneſſe, Coloſſ. 1. verſ. 9.10.11. Some others that haue receiued more knowledge he ſeeketh to caſt downe through pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, he tempteth them to be puffed vp, and to ſwell, and ſo leadeth them into ſectes, errours, and hereſies, as his fit occaſion ſerueth, one parte into one, another into another.</p>
               <p>Heere is need of ſound knowledge of heauenlie thinges, and of that ſincere faith which purgeth the heart, and emptieth it of pride and humaine preſumption, leading men to reſt only vpon God with feare and trembling, euen with true humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Alſo as hee perceiueth mens inclination, hee tempteth and leadeth them into grieuous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable ſinnes, and ſuch as God is highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed withal, ſome into one, and ſome into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21168:31"/>and ſo caſteth them downe. And in this hee is woonderfull ſubtill, and can finde what ſinne a man may moſt eaſilie bee brought into. If he bee inclined to vaine mirth and ieſting, hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to fit him with companions for that: that when he hath receiued the touch of heauenlie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that vaine mirth may put it out. If hee bee inclined to vncleane luſtes of fornication, he wil finde the meanes (if it bee poſſible) to ſet as it were the bait before him, where hee may bee inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And ſo is it in all other vices: ſo that men had need watch and pray leaſt they enter into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. They neede to bee armed with a ſtedfaſt faith to reliſte, that by their faith, all the firie dartes of this horrible enemie may bee quenched. His ſubtilties to keepe men in blindneſſe, his lies and ſlaunders to driue men from the Goſpell, his aſſaultes to lead into deſpaire, his ſtumbling blocks and terrours to turne men out of the way, his temptation to leade into hereſies and ſectes, or into any foule ſinne, or whatſoeuer dartes hee ſhooteth, there is no way to reſiſt him, and to be kept ſafe, but by a true, a liuely, and a ſtedfaſt faith. Therefore (beloued) ſeeing this enemie is ſo vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, &amp; doth ſo cruellie ſeek our deſtruction night and day, euen to ſwallow vs vp into the gulfe of hell: and ſeeing he hath ſo manie ſleightes, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trappes, ſo manie baytes and allurementtes, ſo manie firy dartes to wounde vnto death: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are ſo readie to bee ſeduced, hauing no power of our ſelues; let vs ſeeke to bee ſtronglie
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21168:31"/>armed with the power of God, that ſo wee may get the victorie. There is no way for vs to bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the power of God, but by faith; ſo that the ende of all is this, that men labour for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrengthening of their faith: vſe all good meanes and that continually for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſame. If vpon ſuch a danger wee will not bee admoniſhed by this wholeſome admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle, we are more then fooliſh or mad.</p>
               <p>It may be ſome man will ſay that the diuell is to be reſiſted onlie by faith when he commeth to hutte the ſoule: but is it not another caſe when he commeth to hurte the bodie, the cattell, or the goods of a man? Is he then alſo to be reſiſted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by faith? Or is it all one when he commeth to doe thoſe thinges of himſelfe, and when he is ſent to doe them by witches and ſorcerers? Is there now no meanes to reſiſt him but by faith? To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to this queſtion, firſt it is to bee graunted that the diuels doe indeed delight to torment and to hurt man any way. And withal we ſee it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie taught in the ſcriptures that he hath had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and leaue ſometimes granted vnto him ſo for to hurt: As it was granted vnto him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Iobs goods, ſome by fire, and ſome taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by robbers: to kill his children, and then to plague him in his body with moſt grieuous ſores. Wee read of many in the Goſpell whoſe bodies were poſſeſſed with diuelles, and whome hee did torment in verie grieuous maner.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:21168:32"/>
               <p>And we muſt know withall that when he doth hurt in the bodie or in the goods, his chiefe drift and practiſe is thereby to deſtroy both body and ſoule, and ſo he may make it a meane to win the ſoule, hee will ceaſe for to hurt the body, ſeeming as if he were expelled. We read in the Goſpell of two poſſeſſed with diuels, and Ieſus caſting forth the Diuels, they beſought him to giue them leaue to enter into an hearde of ſwine, hee gaue them leaue, they entered, and caried the whole hearde of ſwine headlong from a ſteepe place into the ſea, and drowned them, Math. 8. What was the purpoſe of thoſe Diuelles, what was their deſire? Was it no more then for to deſtroy the poore dumbe beaſtes? Yes verely they had a further reach, &amp; a deeper practiſe. This it was, they ſought to bring Chriſt into hatred with the men of that region among whom hee was nowe come: and why? but euen that they might not heare him bringing the word of life. They knewe that thoſe men were worldly minded, and that the loſſe of their hogges woulde grieue them ſore, and that they had rather be without Chriſt, then that hee ſhould bring them ſuch loſſe. And ſo it came to paſſe, for the men of that citie came forth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to depart out of their coaſtes. Here was a craftie conueyance, and ſo Satan, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he obtayneth power to hurt the body of man, his cattell or goods, it is not without ſome great ſubtiltie of a further and a greater miſchiefe which he ſeeketh to worke. Then further we may
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21168:32"/>bee ſure that it is all one whether he come of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or be ſent by a witch. For I take it, none will be ſo ſimple as to imagine that if hee haue power to hurt, that he will lie ſtill and not hurt vnleſſe hee be ſent by ſome man or woman. And if hee haue not leaue granted him from God, no mortal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can giue him power to touch the body or cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of a man. Howſoeuer he commeth, wee muſt knowe it is the Lorde GOD of heauen that hath ſent him, euen as hee gaue him leaue to deale with Iob.</p>
               <p>Then it muſt needs follow, that there is no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer for to reſiſt him withall, but the power of God: and there is no way to be armed with that power, but onelie by faith. If there bee no way to withſtand Satan but by the power of God (as it is moſt wicked to denie) and through faith onelie man is armed with that power, what other way or meanes can there bee to reſiſt him? There was a child poſſeſſed with a Diuell: the father brought him to the Diſciples of Chriſt, that they might caſt him out; but they could not; Ieſus caſt him out. Then the Diſciples did aske him why they coulde not caſt him out? Hee ſaid vnto them, becauſe of your vnbeleefe. This kind (ſaith he) goeth not out but by prayer &amp; faſting, Math. 17. Where wee ſee that the diuel torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the body, is to be caſt out by faith, yea by a ſtrong faith, which is to bee aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with faſting and prayer. But what if the diuell (ſay ſome) afflicting the bodie, or deſtroying the goods cannot be remooued by faith or withſtood,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21168:33"/>ſhall not men then ſeeke to remooue him, or to withſtande him ſome other wayes? As wee are taught by experience, that the diuell poſſeſſing the bodie of ſome man, woman or child, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the ſame, prayer hath been vſed, and that very often, and yet no remedie hath beene found, but by other meanes he hath been expelled. Yea, ſome haue been of that minde that God hauing giuen Satan power to touch their bodies, their children, or their goods, they would ſeeke no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to God, ſaying, that as hee had giuen him power, ſo when it ſhould pleaſe him hee woulde reſtraine him, and thereupon they would reſt: but in the ende they haue beene glad to vſe other meanes. God hath appointed meanes, and they tempt God that refuſe them. If a man be fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ditch, and lie ſtill praying, God helpe mee, Lord help me, and doth not ſtir to clime out, hee may he long enough. If there be meanes by which the diuell is driuen out, why ſhould not men vſe them, ſeeing we may ſuppoſe that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thoſe meanes? To anſwer vnto theſe thinges, we may firſt conſider, that the Lord God for the triall of their faith and patience, doth giue leaue to Satan to afflict his children. This is for their good. What ſhould I vſe any proofe for this, but the exemple of ſob? He was throughlie tried. Now ſeeing it was the will of God that he ſhould ſo be tried, both for his owne good, and for the inſtruction of many others, though his faith were a right ſtrong faith, yet in this thing it did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21168:33"/>Satan, but he had power giuen him to touch his goods, children and body. And ſo we may hold it vndoubtedly, that if God will giue power or leaue vnto Satan to touch the bodie, the children, or the goods of any faithfull man, for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as this was in Iob, faith doth not remooue him from ſo afflicting: but faith in thoſe ſo for a time afflicted doth reſiſt him, ſo that hee doth not nor cannot preuaile againſt the ſoule. That is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for vs. Such a man is to ſubmit himſelfe to the chaſtiſement of God for his trial. If Satan can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remooued from hurting him in thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thinges which are of leſſe value, let him hold faſt that he reſiſt him by faith, ſo that hee win not his ſoule and he is well: the Lord God will in his good time deliuer him from that other calamitie. Let him knowe it is for his good that he is ſo cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed.</p>
               <p>The woman of Canaan, Math. 15. was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a wonderfull faith, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I haue not found ſo great faith in Iſraell,</hi> and yet the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell did torment her daughter. She did not ſeeke any other meanes, but ſought out Chriſt, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of him to haue the Diuell caſt out, which did ſo grieuouſly torment her child. This was for her triall, and ſhe did for the time endure it, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the diuell ſo mightilie by faith that he could not preuaile againſt her ſoule.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the diuell hath power giuen vnto him to afflict ſome, and to plague them in their bodies or in their goods, becauſe of their ſinnes.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21168:34"/>They haue deſpiſed the lawes of God, they bee careleſſe to knowe the way of ſaluation. When this ſcourge is vpon them, they are to weigh and to conſider how grieuouſlie they haue offended, and how much they haue prouoked the Lorde to wrath, who hath therfore giuen leaue to this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enemie ſo to plague them. They ſhould nowe ſeeke vnto the Lorde and intreate him to haue mercie vpon them. They ſhould lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile their ſinnes, and turne from their wicked wayes vnto the way of righteouſneſſe: and then ſhould this their calamitie be a meane to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neerer to God, to the ſaluation of their ſoules. They are to intreat the Lorde vpon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to remooue the plague from them. And if it bee not remooued, they are ſtill more and more to be humbled, they ought to faſt and pray, yea they are to vſe all good meanes to come to the true knowledge of God, and to a ſound faith, that they may eſcape from being deuoured by this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie vnto eternall damnation. If the Lorde doe not deliuer them by and by, but that they be tormented in their owne bodies, or in their children or goods, let them knowe it is becauſe they doe not ſo throughly repent, nor ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeek the Lord as they ought to doe. Let them therefore yet humble themſelues further, and ſeek more earneſtlie to knowe the way of God, and to be armed with true and liuely faith.</p>
               <p>There was a woman which had a ſpirite of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie eighteen yeares, and was bowed together
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21168:34"/>and was bowed together, and could in no wiſe lift vp her ſelfe: Ieſus healed her, and ſaid, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had bound her eighteen yeares. Luk. 13. ver. 11.13.15. If the Lord ſhall giue Satan power ſo long to afflict, let vs not fall from God: let vs not ſeek to reſiſt him anie way but by faith. Ye ſay it is knowne by experience, that where the diuell hath tormented ſome, prayer and all holie means haue beene vſed, and yet no helpe at all, vntill other meanes haue been ſought. Then belike there be meanes which are ſtronger againſt the deuill then faith &amp; prayer. And there is ſome power mightier againſt him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of god: for thoſe means which ſome men flie vnto, when as they cannot preuaile by faith, are ſuch as they which are afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted haue learned either by a preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel himſelf, ſaying, let ſuch or ſuch a thing be don, and there ſhall be remedie; or els they haue them preſcribed by ſome wiſe man, or wiſe woman, who haue them from the diuell. Theſe be very pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie things (as there be a number, I need not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate them, they bee too well knowne, and too much practiſed) and yet they be more ſought vnto then faith is, which armeth vs with the power of God. What a diſhonor is this to the high Maieſtie of the Almightie? What an infidelitie is it? Shall men run to the diuell for help? Is he fitter to teach them or of more power then God?</p>
               <p>But ye ſay, we ſee the thing is wrought by thoſe meanes which could not otherwiſe be obtayned, Satan is expelled, and eaſe hath followed. Hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21168:35"/>expelled Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? or hath he taught how he might be expelled indeede? Is the diuell become ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Wil he hinder his owne kingdome? Are men ſo fooliſh as to beleeue that he is by ſuch things in very deed driuen out? A man tormented ſore in his bodie, he feareth that it is ſome witch that hath done it. He is aduiſed by his neighbours to ſende vnto ſome cunning man. Worde is ſent backe, that indeed he hath bad neighbours: let him do ſuch or ſuch a thing, and he ſhal haue eaſe. Well, he doth it &amp; hath eaſe. What ſhall we think that the diuell is driuen out? A wofull driuing out. He doth ceaſe from tormenting the bodie for a time, that he may enter deeper into the ſoule. He winneth by this driuing out. The like may be ſaid where he hath power giuen vnto him to deſtroy mens cattell. They be taught many thinges howe to reſiſt him: among other to offer ſome burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vnto him, they muſt burne ſomwhat aliue. Well he commeth no more: there is a power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue faith that hath put him to flight. And where as you ſay that ſome haue beene of the minde that they would not ſeek any way or meanes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, and would reſt vntil he ſhould reſtrain the diuell: but haue been glad in the ende to vſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes. It is a lamentable hearing, that the ſaith of any ſhould ſo farfaile: that in ſteed of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching neerer to God by ſtrong repentance, they haue turned to the counſell of the diuell. If they could not find helpe by praier, they might be aſſured that the Lord would yet afflict them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21168:35"/>&amp; that with al humblenes they ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues vnder his mightie hand: yea they ought to haue conſidered the weakneſſe of their faith, and the grieuouſnes of their ſinnes, and ſo haue ſought by all meanes poſſible to get a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt faith, and vnfained repentance. This their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by Satan ſhould haue been a warning vnto them, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cleaue more firmlie to God, &amp; to look better to themſelues, and ſee how it hath driuen them to run backe from God to the diuell. But you ſay God hath appointed meanes, and hee that refuſeth the meanes tempteth God. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſhal a man crie, Lord help, and not ſtirre? Indeed if you could prooue that God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch meanes to driue away diuels where faith cannot, your ſaying were true. But where can you prooue in al the whole word of God that any ſuch meanes are appointed to put diuels to flight? If thoſe meanes be not in the holie Scriptures, they be not ordained of God, they be not of faith, it is not the power of God that expelleth Satan, but it is his owne ſleight that ſeemeth to be repelled and vanquiſhed, when he is not; they be means of his own deuiſing, which he hath taught by thoſe that haue familiarity with him.</p>
               <p>The holie Scriptures do condemne it as a moſt wicked thing, that men ſhould haue any dealing with diuels to be taught at their handes. Wee are to be taught of God, Chriſt Ieſus is our onely Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor: ſhall we then learne at the mouth of Diuels? A man is taken lame, he ſuſpecteth that hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21168:36"/>he ſendeth to the cunning man: Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth whom they ſuſpect, and then ſheweth the image of the partie in a glaſſe. When this is done he ſheweth and preſcribeth what the lame man ſhall doe for to get remedie: howe hee ſhall cauſe the olde witch to come vnto him, and how he ſhall vſe her. Heer all is done by the direction of the diuell: are theſe meanes then appointed by God? Alſo there is one whome Sathan doth as it were poſſeſſe and doth torment the bodie: there is ſeeking vnto god, but not like the Cananitiſh wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man that came to Chriſt to haue the diuel driuen out of her daughter, who with the ſtrength of her faith would not be denied, Math. 15. but like to king Saule, who receiuing no anſwere from God, gate him by and by vnto a Witch: for not finding helpe by faith and prayer, or by thoſe waies that God hath appointed, they then begin to hearken to the diuell, and he telleth them that if they ſhall doe ſuch a thing, ſuch a diuell ſhall depart. Heere be the meanes, which ſome doe holde to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God.</p>
               <p>But is not this a woonderfull blindnes that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can ſet vp himſelfe to bee a teacher, and men learning of him, ſhall thinke that they learne of God? Well ſay ſome, wee are glad to haue eaſe, we find that the diuell is expelled, we may think that God doth allow it. Shall a man be glad for to buy eaſe ſo deare? May we call that eaſe, when the diuell ceaſeth to vexe the body for a time, to the end that he may torment ſoule and bodie in hell
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21168:36"/>for euer? If a man be ſicke of a burning ague, and take that to coole the heat, and to giue eaſe for the time, which will afterwarde cauſe it to bee more burning, is that a good remedie? Is that a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, which for a little while doth ſeeme to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate, but afterward doth increaſe the diſeaſe? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the blind people doe imagine that Satan is expelled by thoſe meanes, by which indeed he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth more deepe into them. For tell me but this, wherein doth the kingdome of the Diuel conſiſt? Is he not called the prince of this world, and the prince of darkneſſe? This his kingdome doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in infidelitie, in darkneſſe and in ſinne. Hee that is vnder the power of ſinne, ſo that ſinne hath dominion ouer him, hee is vnder the power and working of Satan. Sinne is his kingdome, there is his throne, ye cannot ſeparate them, he cannot be caſt forth, and ſinne ſtill remaine in force. If pride, enuie, couetouſneſſe, hatred, malice, ſelfe-loue, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, or any other ſuch ſinne doe raigne and rule in the heart of man, there ruleth the diuell: for theſe be the workes of the diuell. Heereupon our Sauiour ſaid to the Iewes, <hi>Ye are of your father the diuell: ye doe the workes of your father. Ioh.</hi> 8. Hee that will then caſte foorth the diuell, hee muſt caſt out thoſe workes. For hee that committeth ſinne is of the diuell, as Saint Iohn ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle chap. 3. Hee that ſtill committeth ſinne, and therefore is of the diuell, is the diuell expelled or driuen from him? I ſuppoſe that there is no man ſo void of reaſon, that he will imagine, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21168:37"/>the diuell is driuen away from that man in whoſe heart he hath his throne and power. A man is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the word and waies of God: with his ignorance of neceſſitie goeth vnbeleefe: with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe there goe the vnfruitfull workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. There is much vanitie of minde, there is much prophaneneſſe, there be foule errors and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable vices.</p>
               <p>This man hath ſome of his cattell deſtroyed by the diuell: he would haue the diuel expelled, he hath not faith which armeth men with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God: he hath not the faith which ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the world, 1. Ioh. 5. or which purgeth the heart. Act. 15. or which quencheth all the firie dartes of the diuell. Epheſ 6. or (as Saint Peter ſaith heere) reſiſteth him: And ſeeketh ſome other helps to reſiſt him, yea, to be deliuered from him, and neuer doth conſider that hee is firſt to haue him remooued out of his heart. He ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the diuell (as Saint Paule ſaith) worketh in the children of diſobedience. Epheſ. 2. verſ. 2. And therfore ſo long as he is diſobedient to God, Satan cannot bee caſt foorth of his heart. If thoſe things can reſiſt Satan which men doe learne and practiſe heere in the world, as there be a thouſand deuiſes, by which he perſwadeth the world that he is reſiſted: then it skilleth not whether a man bee godlie or vngodlie, faithful or vnfaithful, touching the reſiſting &amp; putting diuelles to flight. If when a mans cattell are plagued and deſtroyed by the diuell, it will deliuer the reſt if he burne one aliue:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21168:37"/>this way may the lew, or the Turke, or the heathen eaſt him out as well as the Chriſtian. And ſo it may be ſaid in all other their wicked means. They tend wholie therefore to this ende, that men may be held in infidelitie, in blindneſſe, and hardneſſe of heart, euen void of repentance for their ſinnes, that is the craftineſſe of Satan. For if diuels can bee put to flight and ouercome by ſuch meanes, men will neuer ſeek to be armed with faith, they neuer care for true repentance: they bee perſwaded that the diuell hath nothing to doe with them. And therein lyeth one of the greateſt ſubtilties of Satan that hee may deuour men when they dreame of no perill, and therefore ſeek not to God, to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his mightie power through faith. For when men doe knowe that there is no way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape but by faith (as Saint Peter ſaith heer, <hi>whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith</hi>) if they be not mad, they will haue a care to attaine to that true faith.</p>
               <p>In the Poperie there were many things deuiſed to driue away diuels. Men were perſwaded that the ſigne of the Croſſe did put him to flight. They had their coniured holiwater to ſprinkle vpon the men, and in their houſes, &amp; thither the Diuel might not come. Likewiſe if a man had a peece of holie bread in his purſe, or any where about him, hee was armed hee might goe ſafe in the darkeſt night that was. There were hallowed candles, and within the light of them the wicked Prince of darkneſſe could not approch. But there was yet a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21168:38"/>ſtronger thing and a more terrible vnto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, then all the reſt, euen to hunt them out of the countrie.</p>
               <p>The Lorde ſendeth lightening and thunder, and mightie windes: hee doth therby declare his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. When theſe tempeſtes doe ariſe, the diuell woulde gladly make men beleeue that hee hath raiſed them: hee would be as a God of power: and therfore he coueteth to ſhew himſelf in thoſe tempeſtes, and ſo doth come with terrour. To meet with this miſchiefe and to repell him, the Papiſtes had their hallowed belles, their Saintes belles, and thoſe they did ring out when any terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tempeſt did approch, truſting that the ſounde of them would repel him, and put him to flight. O how the Diuell was skared with theſe things! S. Peter forgate himſelfe that he did not tel of theſe, and not ſpeake of reſiſting him by nothing but by faith. Such readie helpes for to defend men, and ſo eaſie, and not one of the Apoſtles would tell of them: but ſpeake only of faith to bee our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie. Well (beloued) knowe for certaintie that all theſe are but ſleights of the Diuell: which were vſed in the poperie, and which many at this day doe vſe when they ſuppoſe that they are bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Leaue all ſuch vngodly waies which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell teacheth, and hearken to the holy Ghoſt, which willeth you to reſiſt the Diuell ſtedfaſt in the faith. Let all your ſtudie, and induſtrie, and care be, to bee armed with a ſtrong and liuelie
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21168:38"/>faith. That ſhall couer you, and compaſſe you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the almighty power of God. Yee ſhall bee as the mount Sion (faith the Prophete in the Pſalme) that cannot be remooued. All the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall powers (or as Chriſt ſaith, the gates of hell) ſhall not preuaile againſt it. If you haue that faith, the roaring Lyon ſhall not deuoure you: but all his firie dartes ſhall bee quenched. Hee will doe what he can to holde you in blindneſſe, to leade you into ſinne, and into hereſies, he wil tempt you to deſpaire, but your faith ſhall preuaile. He will ſeek to hurt your bodies &amp; goods, reſiſt him by faith. Bleſſed be our Lord that hath giuen vs ſuch a tower of refuge. Amen.</p>

Wee haue alſo in the ſecond place ſeene the cauſe why it behooueth vs to be watchfull. There is an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that doth ſeek to deuoure vs both ſoules and bodies vnto eternall deſtruction. <hi>Your aduerſarie the diuell</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>like a roaring Lyon walketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſeeking whom hee may deuour.</hi> In the thirde place we haue been taught how to withſtand him and to get the victorie ouer him. <hi>Whom reſist ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the faith.</hi> Where it hath beene ſhewed, that faith armeth a man with the power of God. The power of God is inuincible &amp; cannot be brought vnder, but getteth the victorie ouer all the terrible might of Diuels: ſo that it is not poſſible that hee ſhould be ouercome which hath faith. It conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all the infernall powers, and triumpheth at all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21168:39"/>times moſt gloriouſly ouer them. Whereby it is manifeſt what a woonderfull rich and precious iewell faith is. It preſerueth vs ſafe from diuelles, and therefore is to bee coueted and ſought for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all treaſures. It is to bee ſought for at the handes of God, he is the giuer of it, and it is not a thing which is in mans owne power. Moreouer, ſeeing God doth giue it, and nouriſh it by means, he that will be ſtedfaſt in the faith, muſt vſe thoſe meanes that be ordained. Alſo it hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that faith is the onlie thing by which wee are to reſiſt the Diuell: in as much as faith alone armeth vs with the glorious power of God. Satan hath manie waies whereby he ſeeketh to deuoure and to ſwallow vp into hell the ſoules and bodies of men: as to holde ſome in blindneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to lead others into ſectes, errours and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, to drawe men into vices and abominable ſinnes, to plague the bodies and the cattell of men: but which way ſoeuer hee commeth, faith doth quench all his firie dartes arming the ſoule of man, couering and compaſſing it round about with the mightie power of God. Al thoſe vain, yea thoſe moſt wicked means by which men ſeek to repell Satan, are to be renounced as meere illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Men are to bee taught of God, and not to learne of diuelles: but Diuelles haue deuiſed thoſe means, and by ſuch as haue familiaritie with them haue deliuered the ſame to bee put in practiſe. As there be ſuch deuiſes among the Sorcerers which Satan hath craftily conueighed in: ſo alſo in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21168:40"/>Poperie they did not ſeeke as Saint Peter willeth to reſiſt him by faith, but inuented other wayes. Thus far we proceeded in handling this Scripture: And now it remaineth as a principall queſtion to be handeled, whether this faith, by which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is to be reſiſted, can be ouercome in any? that is, to ſpeake more plainlie, whether any man that hath the true and liuelie faith, by which the diuell is reſiſted, can vtterly looſe it, and fall from God finallie? whether his faith may vtterly faile and be vanquiſhed, &amp; ſo hauing reſiſted Satan for a time ſtedfaſt in the faith, yet in the end he may be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and deuoured by him?</p>
               <p>Touching this queſtion, the Papiſts doe holde that a man may haue the true and liuely faith, and ſo fall from it, as that it be vtterly &amp; wholie quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in him, yea finally. And ſo by their doctrine ſuch as doe ſtand in this faith which Saint Peter requireth, and with the ſame doe reſiſt the diuel, may by the diuell haue that ſame their ſound and true faith ouercome, and ſo periſh eternally. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there be, who will ſeeme to differ ſomewhat from the Popiſh ſort about this matter, and they do hold that the verie reprobate (ſome of them at the leaſt) are partakers for a time of the true, liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and iuſtifying faith, which is afterward wholie and finallie extinguiſhed in them. Moreouer, they doe hold, that the ſame true and liuely faith may be wholy extinguiſhed in the elect, but not finally, becauſe it is vnpoſſible that the elect ſhuld periſh, and therein they differ indeede from the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21168:40"/>Papiſtes, which make election conditionall. If this doctrine of theirs bee true, then is there no man that can be certaine of his ſaluation. There is no man that is ſure he ſhall ſtand to the end, no man can reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith. For hee that to day doth get the victorie ouer the diuell by a true and liuely faith, to morrow may vtterly looſe his faith, and be ouercome by the diuell. If it bee ſo, then hath not Saint Peter heer taught how we ſhal haue vndoubted victorie: if he will vs to reſiſt by ſuch a weapon as may be broken or deſtroyed, or plucked away from vs, wee are then but in a very weake caſe.</p>
               <p>It may be they will ſay, there is vndoubted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie ſo long as a man doth reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith: and that Saint Peter hath no further intent. That is the thing which we are to enquire of. And this ſhall be made manifeſt, that whoſoeuer hath the true and liuely faith, ſhall vndoubtedly get the victorie ouer Satan: that it is vnpoſſible that his faith ſhould be wholie extinguiſhed, it is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he ſhould periſh.</p>
               <p>This is it which we affirme, that whoſoeuer doth attaine vnto a ſtedfaſt faith (which is the thing which Saint Peter here requireth) that faith can neuer bee ouercome: for if it bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, it is not ſtedfaſt. It is the purpoſe of Saint Peter, not to teach that ſo long as a man is ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the faith, ſo long he ſhall reſiſt the Diuell, and get the victorie, taking this, ſo long, as if it were vncertaine that hee which is once ſtedfaſt,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21168:41"/>ſhall continue to the end: but this is his full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that ſo manie as attaine to be ſtedfaſt in the faith, ſhall vndoubtedlie vanquiſh Satan, and neuer be vanquiſhed by him. Hitherto then ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his doctrine, euen to ſhewe, that as wee are compaſſed about and beſet with diuels, who like moſt greedy deuouring Lyons doe ſeeke conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for to ſwallowe vs vp: ſo if we ſeek ſo farre as to be armed with a ſtedfaſt faith, wee attaine to that eſtate out of which wee can neuer bee caſt. It is as much as if he ſhould ſay, the Diuell can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ouercome a ſtedfaſt faith: obtaine that and you are ſure to ſtand to the end.</p>
               <p>Beloued, wee are not then to labour onelie for faith, but if we will be ſure to ouercome the diuel, and to ſtand to the end, we muſt labour to obtain a ſtedfaſt faith. But how can we bee ſure that this is the mind of the Apoſtle, to warrant men, that they ſhall get the victorie ouer the diuell, euen to the end, if they attaine vnto a ſtedfaſt faith? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that hee agreeth with himſelfe, teaching here the ſame thing which hee exhorteth vnto in the firſt chapte rof his ſecond Epiſtle: <hi>Hereunto</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>giue all diligence, in your faith miniſter vertue, in vertue knowledge, in knowledge tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in temperance patience, in patience godlines, in godlineſſe brotherlie kindneſſe, in brother lie kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe loue. For if theſe things be among you, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, they will make that you neither ſhall be idle nor vnfruitful in the knowledging of our lord Ieſus Chriſt. For he that hath not theſe thinges is blinde,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21168:41"/>and cannot ſee a farre off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his olde ſinnes. Wherefore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren giue rather diligence to make your calling &amp; election ſure: for if ye doe theſe thinges, ye ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fall. For by this means an entring ſhal be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto you abundantly into the euerlaſting king dome of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.6.7.8.9.10.11. In this place S. Peter doth moſt plainlie affirme that they which haue ſuch a faith as goeth with thoſe fruites, they come to an aſſurance that they be called of god, &amp; choſen vnto life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and he doth aſſure and warrant them that they ſhall neuer fall. Hee addeth as a reaſon that they haue an entrance into the kingdome of Chriſt, which is euerlaſting. If the true liuely faith may faile and be wholy loſt, what aſſurance can anie man haue that hee is called of God and choſen to life eternall? Or how could the holie Apoſtle ſay, <hi>If yee doe theſe things ye ſhall neuer fall?</hi> Doe not they fall which looſe the faith, or in whome it is wholy quenched? Chriſt raigneth in all thoſe which haue the liuely faith, and if his kingdome may be broken downe againe where it once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth place, how can it be ſaid in euery reſpect to be eternall?</p>
               <p>Now to ioyne theſe two places together, that man hath the ſtedfaſt faith whereby he doth reſiſt the diuel, which doth thoſe things which S. Peter mentioneth, and thereby is ſure hee is called and choſen, and that he ſhall neuer fall. Hee is firme &amp; ſtedfaſt in the faith which commeth vnto this:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21168:42"/>and ſuch as haue proceeded no further in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of a fruitfull faith, but that they be ſtill vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whether they ſhall ſtand to the ende, howe can they be ſaid to reſiſt the diuell ſtedfaſt in the faith? When S. Paule telleth vs that the ſhielde of faith doth quench all the firie dartes of the Diuel, it is to giue courage and comfort, that ſuch as haue once gotten that ſhield, ſhall neuer be ouercome: for if the faith bee ouercome, then it doth not quench them all. The like courage and comfort Saint Peter doth heere miniſter, by ſhewing that being ſtedfaſt in the faith Satan is reſiſted. Where a man is ſure to get the victorie how valiantlie hee doth fight, what aſſaultes he wil endure, and with what comfort and conſolation of minde. But if the battell be made doubtfull, that although hee haue ſo liuely a faith which woorketh by charitie, yet he may looſe it, he may be ouercome, it daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and diſcourageth, it taketh away the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation. And this is to ouerthrowe that which the Lord of ſpeciall purpoſe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to his children, namely, that in all the trials, and afflictions, and temptations which they paſſe through, they may haue ſtrong conſolation. For it is written, <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantlie to ſhewe vnto the heires of promiſe the ſtableneſſe of his counſell confirmed by an oth, that by two immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things in which it was impoſſible for God to ly, we might haue ſtrong conſolation. Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 17.18. If God hath confirmed his promiſe by an oth, that all they which beleeue in his ſonne ſhall haue
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21168:42"/>eternall life, why is it, or to what end is it, but that wee ſhould come to the aſſurance of ſaluation, without which aſſurance there can be no ſtrong conſolation? If men bee condemned for high treaſon, and then ſome hope of pardon followeth, it ſomewhat comforteth that they may ſuppoſe it may be they ſhall eſcape the tormentes of death, and not be executed; but ſo long as there is doubt they haue no ſtrong conſolation: but when they know aſſuredly, &amp; haue it confirmed vnto them that they are ſet free by pardon, then is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſtrong indeede. We are all of vs for high treaſon againſt God condemned to hell to endure eternall tormentes: A couenant and promiſe is made, that ſo many as doe beleeue in the ſonne of God ſhall haue free pardon, and ſo not onelie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from thoſe endleſſe miſeries, but alſo be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp into eternall glorie. So manie as doe wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſenſiblie conſider this wofull and miſerable eſtate, in which all are in by nature, cannot but be touched with great horror and fear. For is it a light matter to be caſt with the diuell and his Angels into eternal fire? Is hee not more then mad which can be merie ſo long as he is ſubiect vnto ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible damnation? Wel, there is hope of pardon, that ſo hee ſhall eſcape, in as much as God hath not only giuen his ſonne to bee a redeemer, but hath promiſed and bounde that his promiſe with an oath, that euery one which beleeueth ſhall bee ſaued. Hee feeleth that he hath a faith, and it doth comfort him: but vntill he feele that the ſame his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21168:43"/>faith is the true and liuelie faith which getteth the victorie ouer Satan, and which can neuer be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, he cannot haue ſtrong conſolation. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall woe with the diuelles in hell is a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous thing, &amp; vnpoſſible it is that any man ſhuld haue ſtrong conſolation, vnleſſe he be ſure that he ſhall be deliuered from it: Whereupon it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that ſeeing the bleſſed Lord God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that his children ſhall heere in the midſt of the battell againſt Satan haue ſtrong conſolation, that he doth alſo giue vnto them aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of faith, yea ſuch a faith as they doe knowe can neuer be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome. Take away the one &amp; take away the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherby we ſee that they which do hold that the true and liuelie faith may be wholy loſt, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſtableneſſe of Gods couenant. If they will obiect that manie haue great gladneſſe and conſolation which haue not any true faith, I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the blind world is drowned in a carnall conſolation, they doe not ſoundly beleeue, nor ſenſiblie conſider what eſtate they be in. They be but as drunken men, who through exceeding drunkenneſſe paſsing towards horrible torments, do not perceiue it nor regard it, but are merie and laugh and ſport themſelues: For they which are ſo merie and doe ſport themſelues ſo much in ſinne and in carnall pleaſures, if they did knowe or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly conſider whither they be going and what remaineth for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it would dampe all their mirth. It is not the ſtrong conſolation which the holie Ghoſt ſpeaketh of, that they haue. Theirs is but a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21168:43"/>drunken madneſſe. Such onlie as by a liuely faith doe feele the power of Chriſt in them mortifying and ſlaying ſinne, &amp; quickening them vnto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and true holineſſe euen to walke in the light, and to bring forth the fruites and vertues of the ſpirite, haue the ſtrong conſolation. They bee aſſured that they be deliuered from hell, and made heires of eternall glorie: in as much as they know that God doth ſanctifie none but thoſe whome he doth glorifie. But they doe alleage ſundrie teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the holie Scriptures, by which they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prooue that the verie reprobate haue the true, liuely and iuſtifying faith, which they do vtterlie looſe: and likwiſe, that the elect doe ſo fall, that the ſame true and liuelie faith for a time is vtterlie quenched in them. If it be ſo, then all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is gone, and with it there vaniſheth away all ſtrong conſolation For if the true faith bee in the reprobate, then cannot any man thus argue, I haue the true, liuely and ſanctifying faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am choſen of God and ſure to bee ſaued. Neither can he ſay thus, If I fall, I ſhal riſe againe: for what is it that can aſſure him that he ſhall riſe againe, if ſome that haue the ſame true faith which he hath, doe fal and neuer riſe againe? Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider what their proofes bee, or teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vpon which they ſtande, to prooue that the true faith may be vtterly loſt. In the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is thus written, <hi>But when the righteous doth turne away from his righteouſneſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit iniquity, and doth according to all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21168:44"/>which the wicked doth, ſhould he liue? all his righteous dee des which he hath done ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: for his tranſgreſſion in which hee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth, and for his ſinne in which hee ſinneth, for theſe he ſhall die. Ezech.</hi> 18.24. The Lord Ieſus ſaith, that there bee ſome which do beleeue for a time, &amp; in time of temptation goe away. Luk. 8.13. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt</hi> (ſaith S. Paul) <hi>by faith: be not high minded, but feare,</hi> Rom. 11. ver. 20. Alſo the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſome that made ſhipwrack of the faith. 1. Tim. 1. verſ. 19. Hee that thinketh hee ſtandeth, let him take heed leaſt he fall. 1. Cor. 10. ver. 12. Chriſt ſaith to the Angell of the Church of Epheſus. Thou haſt left thy firſt loue, Reue. 2. ver. 4. Take heede leaſt anie man fall away from the grace of God, Heb. 12. verſ. 15. And S. Peter doth ſpeake of ſuch as are like the dog that returneth to his vomite. 2. Pet. 2. There be other places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they doe alſo alleadge to prooue that men that haue the true &amp; liuely faith, may wholy looſe it, I will not ſtand to anſwere euery one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie, but in generall, and thus, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the word of God ſpeaketh of falling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace, of turning from the way of righteouſnes, or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the faith, it is not to bee vnderſtood of the grace of ſanctification or of the true liuely iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, but of that other faith which the holie ſcriptures doe ſpeake of, which the wicked may haue, and of thoſe graces which they alſo are after a ſort made partakers of. For this is ſufficient for me to ſhewe, that whoſoeuer is once partaker of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21168:44"/>the liuelie faith, he can neuer looſe that faith, hee can neuer periſh: for that being prooued it muſt needs be confeſſed that all the ſcriptures which they alleadge are to bee vnderſtood not of that liuely faith, or of thoſe that be ſanctified. I am (ſaith Chriſt) the true vine, and my father is an husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Euery branch in me that beareth not fruite he taketh away, and euery branch in me that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fruite he purgeth that it may beare more fruit. Ioh. 15. verſ. 1.2. Chriſt is the vine, &amp; they which profeſſe his name be the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches. Theſe branches be of two ſortes: the one ſort beareth no fruit, the other ſort beareth fruit. Now let it bee demanded what are they which beare fruit? It muſt needs be anſwered, they be ſuch as haue the true and liuely faith they be ingrafted into Chriſt and doe receiue as it were the ſap or iuice of life from him. Their faith is that, which Saint Paule ſaith, worketh by charity, and therfore euery one that hath that faith beareth fruite. Then who bee thoſe branches that beare not fruite? They be Chriſtians in name and in profeſſion; otherwiſe he would not ſay, Euerie branch in me that beareth not fruit. They be after a ſort grafted alſo into Chriſt in as much as they haue been baptized, and doe profeſſe to beleeue in him: but their faith is but a dead faith; otherwiſe it could not be ſaide, that they beare no fruite. By this we ſee it is euident that there is a difference of faith, there is a fruitleſſe or a dead faith, and there is a faith which is liuely, and cannot but worke. Then ſee how we are to argue out of this place.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21168:45"/>Euery branch that beareth fruit, that is, euery one that hath the true and liuely faith, ſhall be purged, that it may beare more fruit: therefore not any one of the reprobate haue the liuely faith. This conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is cleere, if wee conſider that he ſaith, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie branch that beareth fruit he purgeth, not to take it afterward away, but that it may bear more fruit. For will they be ſo bold as to ſay thus, Some branches that beare fruite ſhall bee taken out of the vine, as well as the branches that beare no fruite? Or thus, Some branches that beare fruite ſhall be purged that they may beare more fruite: but yet in the end they ſhall alſo bee taken out of the vine, were not that a ſtrange ſpeech? What difference, or what a vaine difference were that which Chriſt maketh of the branches, touching perſeuerance in the vine if the fruitfull branches, or any of them could be ſeparated from it, as well as the vnfruitfull? howe doe they make Chriſt to ſpeak? It may be they wil ſay, that the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh ſomtimes vniuerſally, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in particulars are for to be admitted: and ſo his ſaying doth ſtand true although ſome bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that haue born fruit, be taken out of the vine and do periſh. I anſwere, that this cauill is of no force heer, becauſe our Sauiour doth ſo ſpeak vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſallie, that he alſo ſpeaketh ſingularly. He ſaith not al the branches that in me bear fruit, but euery branch in me that beareth fruit, he purgeth that it may beare more fruit. So that we may conclude, that there are none of the reprobate that haue the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21168:45"/>true and liuely faith: for if they had, they ſhoulde bring forth fruit and ſo remain for euer in the vine. Againe, whoſoeuer knoweth that hee bringeth foorth fruite, hee may be aſſured that he ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the vine for euer, hee ſhall neuer periſh. Alſo Chriſt ſaith, I am the breade of life, hee that commeth to me ſhall not hunger in any wiſe, and he that beleeueth in mee ſhall neuer thirſt. This is the will of him that ſent me, that euery one that ſeeth the ſonne and beleeueth in him may haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life: and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day. I am that bread of life, your fathers did eate Manna in the wilderneſſe and are dead. This is that bread that came downe from heauen, that if anie man eate thereof, he ſhould not die. I am the liuing bread which came downe from heauen, if any man eate of this bread he ſhall hue for euer. He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood hath eternall life: This is that bread which came downe from heauen, not as your fathers did eate Manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread ſhall liue for euer. Ioh. 6. ver. 35.40.48.49.50.51.54.58. From theſe Scriptures wee may drawe moſt firme concluſions, that not any one of the reprobate euer haue or can haue the true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie faith: but that whoſoeuer beleeueth he is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of life eternall: Chriſt teacheth that hee is the bread of life, and that whoſoeuer eateth of that bread he ſhall liue for euer. It is not poſſible that any man ſhould eat of that bread, and yet not liue for euer. Euery one that beleeueth in him (I ſpeak
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21168:46"/>of that liuelie faith which as the hand apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chriſt, and by which we receiue him and his benefites) doth eat his fleſh, and drinke his blood. He that beleeueth in mee (ſaith hee) ſhall neuer thirſt: for let any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew a reaſon why ſome that beleeue in Chriſt doe eate his fleſh and drinke his blood, &amp; other ſome, hauing the ſame liuely faith, doe not. What will they ſay that the reprobate &amp; damned, ſo many of them as euercome to haue the true and liuely faith (according as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) do indeede eat the fleſh of Chriſt &amp; drinke his blood, and ſo for a time be made liuely mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, euen fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of his bones, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh Epheſ. 5. ver. 31? If they doe not eat his fleſh &amp; drink his blood, then haue they not the faith: remooue that effect, and the cauſe is remooued. If they will not abhor ſo wicked a ſpeech, but affirm indeed that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate doe eate the fleſh of Chriſt, ſo many of them as haue the liuely faith: then let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee how they ouerthrow alſo the whole force of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt, by which he proueth that the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na was not the bread of life; but that he himſelf is the bread of life. Your fathers (ſaith he) did eat Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in the wilderneſſe and are dead. If any man eat of this bread he ſhal liue for euer. How ſtandeth his argument, conſider of it I pray you. Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe, and yet are dead in their ſinnes they are dead in the ſpirituall and eternall death (for of that death hee ſpeaketh, ſeeing they alſo which eat the fleſh of Chriſt doe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21168:46"/>die the naturall death) therefore Manna was not the bread of life that commeth downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For that which ſome did eat of, and yet did die eternallie, is not by any meanes the bread of life. And how doth hee prooue that hee himſelfe is the bread of life? I am the breade which came downe from heauen: if any man eate of this bread he ſhall liue for euer. Thus ſtandeth his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Whoſoeuer eateth the fleſh of Chriſt, he ſhal liue for euer: therefore the fleſh of Chriſt is the bread of life. If they ſhall now ſay, ſome of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the wildernes did eate the Manna, and yet died in their ſinnes: it cannot be denied: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Chriſt doth affirme that Manna was not the bread of life that commeth downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and then adde their owne ſaying, which is this, ſome doe eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and yet do die in their ſinnes: what will then followe? if this reaſon do ſtand in force; Your fathers did eat Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in the wildernes and are dead: therefore Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na was not the bread of life. Then ſhall not this alſo follow, Many doe eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and yet are damned: therefore the fleſh of Chriſt is not the bread of life. Thus it is euident that ſuch as do affirme that any of the reprobate haue the liuelie faith, doe gainſay Chriſt, and ouerthrow the force of his argument.</p>
               <p>To proceede, what can be more firme to proue that the reprobate cannot haue the true, liuely and iuſtifying faith, then that which Saint Paul hath written? Where this ground is firſt to bee laide,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21168:47"/>that whoſoeuer he is that hath the true iuſtifying faith, he hath the ſpirite of ſanctification, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of adoption: for thus the Apoſtle conioyneth them: wherein alſo after that yee beleeued, yee were ſealed with the holy ſpirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance, vnto the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the purchaſed poſſeſſion, vnto the praiſe of his glorie: Epheſ. 1. ver. 13.14. Is there any ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as to hold that a man is a liuely member of Ieſus Chriſt (as euery one is that hath the liuelie iuſtifying faith) and yet hath not that holy ſpirite of promiſe, that ſpirite of adoption, that ſeale, and that pledge? If they will ſay that the faith which the reprobate doe attaine vnto is without this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of adoption, or without this ſeale or pledge: then doe wee holde with them, and then doth it follow, that the faith of the reprobate is not the true iuſtifying and ſanctifying ſaith which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the heart, Act. 15. But if they ſhall ſay that the reprobate are for a time partakers of the ſpirit of ſanctification, euen of that ſpirit of adoption: then will there diuers right wicked conſequences follow, which are to be baniſhed far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For firſt touching the ſpirit of adoption, ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith; As manie as are led by the ſpirit of god, they are the ſons of God. For ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage again to fear; but ye haue receiued the ſpirit of Adoption, whereby we crie Abba, Father. That ſame ſpirite beareth witneſſe vnto our ſpirit that we are the ſonnes of God. Rom. 8.14, 15, 16. If anie of the reprobate be led by the ſpirit of God, or be at anie time ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21168:47"/>then hath not S. Paule here ſaid true, that as manie as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſonnes of God. Some of the reprobate indeed doe taſte of the heauenly power, but they are not led with the ſpirit of God: they be not ſanctified, they walke not after the ſpirit. Moreouer, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption, the ſanctifying ſpirit which is in al that haue the true, liuely and iuſtifying faith, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth witnes with and to the ſpirit of the beleeuers, that they be the children of God. This is the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith when a man beleeueth that the Lorde God is his father, and that he is the ſonne of God. And this faith is not ſeparated from the ſpirit of adoption, for it is vpon his teſtimonie that they do beleeue, and by him they crie Abba, Father. Is not this ſpirit a true ſpirit? and is not his witnes moſt firme and true? If it be as thoſe men ſay, that the reprobate are partakers of the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then is not his teſtimonie firme and true. For then that ſpirit of adoption teacheth ſome man to call God Father, and witneſſeth to his ſpirit that he is the ſonne of God, when as he is the childe of the diuell: for hauing that faith, and that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the ſpirit in him to day, to morrow he doth by their ſaying, vtterly and finally loſe that faith and that ſpirit. What an opinion is this to ſay that a man hath the true faith, that is to ſay, beleeueth by the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt, that God is his father, and yet he is indeed the child of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell? And moreouer, doth not the Apoſtle ſay, that after they beleeued they were ſealed with the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21168:48"/>holie ſpirit of promiſe? This is more then the bare teſtimonie of the ſpirit, if I may ſo ſpeake, that hee ſealeth. Can this ſeale be diſanulled or broken, or made fruſtrate? Is this ſeale vntrue? If it bee euer ſet vpon the reprobate, it is deceiueable. If their opinion be true: no man can then ſay thus, God hath ſealed me with his ſpirit, therfore I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God: For a reprobate hath that ſeale, and it faileth him: then who can ſay that it is a ſeale, which is true and infallible? Saint Iohn ſhewing vpon what teſtimonies faith in Chriſt is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſaith, There be three that bear record in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Father, the Word, and the holie Spirit, and theſe three are one. And there bee three that bear record in earth, the ſpirit, &amp; water &amp; blood, and theſe three agree in one. If we receiue the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of men, the teſtimonie of God is greater: For this is the witnes which hee teſtifieth of his ſonne, Hee that beleeueth in the ſonne of God, hath the witneſſe in himſelfe. 1. Ioh. 5. verſ. 7.8.9.10. Why are all theſe witneſſes but to giue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith? And if theſe witneſſes doe teſtifie vnto a man that he is the childe of God and ſhall be ſaued (for euery one that hath the true &amp; liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie faith, hath it vpon the teſtimony of all theſe witneſſes) and yet hee is a reprobate: then is not the witneſſe of God greater then the witneſſe of men. Then alſo to what end ſhould he mention all theſe foreſaid witneſſes? They giue an abſolute teſtimonie that euery one that beleeueth hath life euerlaſting.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:21168:48"/>
               <p>By theſe places it is manifeſt that the reprobate cannot be partakers of the ſanctifying faith, they be not led at any time by the ſpirit of adoption, they be not ſealed vp with the holy ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they haue not the witneſſe of God within them: whoſoeuer therefore hath theſe thinges, let him be aſſured he ſhall neuer periſh; but if he be ſanctified, he is iuſtified, hee ſhall bee glorified. Rom. 8. ver. 32. And this is it which the holie Scripture in many places proclameth, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer beleeueth in the ſonne of God, he ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be confounded.</p>
               <p>But what if the reprobate neuer haue the true faith, nor the ſpirit of adoption? yet doe not the elect ſo fall and ſinne ſometimes, that there is no ſparke of true faith left in them for the time? This is the great cunning of the diuell to roote vp as it were the ſtableneſſe and foundation of the truth. But the word of God meeteth with it, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that whoſoeuer is regenerate and borne of God in the new &amp; ſpirituall birth, as euery one is that hath the liuely faith, ſeeing whoſoeuer is in Chriſt, he is a new creature: the ſame man cannot ſo fall that this new birth ſhould be extinguiſhed in him. For this wee haue the teſtimonie vttered by Saint Iohn, in theſe words, Whoſoeuer is born of god ſinneth not, for his ſeed remaineth in him, neither can he ſinne, becauſe hee is borne of God. 1. Ioh. 3. ver. 9. Alſo, we know that whoſoeuer is borne of God ſinneth not, but he that is begotten of God keepeth himſelfe, and that wicked one
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21168:49"/>doth not touch him. chap. 5. verſ. 18. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe two ſayings, there be two members, and vnto either of them, there is annexed a reaſon to confirme the ſame. As whoſoeuer is borne of God ſinneth not: for his ſeede (this is the reaſon) remaineth in him. And then the ſecond member, Neither can hee ſinne: the reaſon, becauſe hee is borne of God. Now ſee if they doe not directlie gainſay the holie Ghoſt, which holde that a man regenerate may looſe the faith, &amp; be vtterly voide of the ſpirit of ſanctification. For firſt, whereas S. Iohn ſaith, that whoſoeuer is born of God, he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not. They ſay, a man hath his faith vtterlie quenched, and is wholie depriued of the ſpirit of adoption. What ſin then is it that he ſinneth not? He that falleth in ſuch ſort as that he becommeth void of the true faith, and of the ſanctifying grace of God, what is he other but as an infidell for the time, and what ſinne is it that he committeth not? Shall it be ſaid of ſuch a man, he ſinneth not? It may be this poore cauill will be vſed, Hee that is borne of God ſinneth not ſo long as he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that eſtate, ſo long as he continueth borne of God. A vaine and moſt fooliſh ſpeech, for if a man that is vnregenerate and borne of GOD through a true and liuelie faith, do ſo fal, it is ſinne that caſteth him downe, then he doth ſinne while he is in that ſtate. For doth hee firſt caſt away his faith, and the grace of the ſanctifying ſpirit, and then commit ſinne, and not before? What greater ſinne then the falling from the faith, and caſting
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21168:49"/>forth vtterlie the grace of ſanctification? But ſee how Saint Iohn meeteth with all cauilles, in the reaſon which he annexeth to confirme that firſt member. Why doth not any one that is borne of God, ſinne? For (ſaith hee) his ſeede remaineth in him. What is the ſeed of God which remaineth in all that are borne of God? The word of God is called the incorruptible ſeed by which God doth beget his children, 1 Pet. 1.23. That word is but an inſtrument, the holie Ghoſt is the worker of the new birth: and therfore our Sauiour teacheth, except a man bee borne againe of water and of the ſpirit, hee cannot enter into the kingdome of God. Ioh. 3. verſ. 5. The ſeed of God then is the graces of the ſanctifying ſpirit, &amp; the liuely word. Thoſe men that ſay, a man may loſe his faith, and the ſpirit of ſanctification, doe in flat ſpeech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie that which the holie Apoſtle heere ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. The ſeed of God (ſaith Saint Iohn) remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in all thoſe which are borne of God, and therfore they doe not ſinne, that is to ſay, they do not ſinne that deadly ſinne of falling from God, or of being ſeparated from Chriſt: which is not true if their ſaying bee true: for there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no ſeed of God in thoſe that doe wholy loſe their faith, and in whome the ſanctifying graces are vtterly extinguiſhed. It may be they wil here again adde their vaine cauill, that the ſeed of God remaineth in them ſo long as they bee borne of God, and hold the faith, and ſtand in grace. As if Saint Iohn ſhould ſay thus, the ſeede of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21168:50"/>in them, ſo long as the ſeede of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in them. Is not this a very wiſe ſpeech to be aſcribed to the holy ghoſt? He ſpeaketh abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that whoſoeuer is borne of God, the ſeed of God euer after doth remaine in him: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſinneth not. Let them go with their ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous diſtinction, the ſeed of God remaineth in them, ſo long as it remaineth in them: for that ſpeech they muſt be forced to vtter, vnleſſe they will confeſſe, that when he ſaith his ſeede remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in them, we muſt take it remaineth in them for euer. If the ſeede of God remaine for euer in the regenerate, then doth faith and the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit remaine in them for euer. For will they ſeparate theſe? But to put all out of doubt, and to miniſter ſound comfort, or (as the holy ghoſt ſpeaketh) ſtrong conſolation to all that haue the true and liuely faith, euen to let them knowe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and vnderſtand for certainty, that they can not periſh, that they cannot be ouercome by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in the battel: he addeth, Neither can he ſinne: confirming it with this reaſon, becauſe he is born of God. What can they ſay vnto this? How will they auoide this? Will they ſay that Saint Iohn meant heere ſome other matter? Is it not clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then the Sunne, that the regenerate cannot wholy bee depriued of faith, nor of the ſpirit of ſanctification, when he ſaith, they can not ſinne? Can they wholie looſe their faith and all the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying grace, and yet can they not ſin? O how happie and bleſſed is the ſtate and condition of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21168:50"/>that man which hath attained to the true &amp; liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie faith, who hath the ſpirit of ſanctification, by which hee is led, euen the ſpirit of adoption that beareth witneſſe with his ſpirit that he is the child of God, ſeeing he may be tempted, and ſundrie times be led awrie into ſome ſinnes, but it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhuld fall from God? And what is the reaſon by which he prooueth that hee cannot ſo fall: Becauſe (ſaith he) he is borne of God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider where the force of this reaſon lieth. Men are mortall, their ſeede is corruptible, and that which is borne of man is corruptible and mortall. God is incorruptible and immortall, and ſo the ſeede of God is called incorruptible ſeed and immortal: whereupon it doth follow that the birth which is of God is incorruptible and immortall. Where the life of God is, it cannot bee be extinguiſhed. Thinke it not ſtrange then that Saint Iohn ſaith, he cannot ſinne, becauſe he is borne of God. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they will denie the manifeſt and cleare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the word of God: except they will affirme that the ſeed of God is corruptible and ſo decayeth, and doth not abide in thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God: except they will alſo make the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the ſpirit of adoption deceiueable &amp; falſe: finally, except they will make the ſeale of God and the pledge which he giueth, of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, denying that men are to make their calling and election ſure, and ſo to haue ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let them renounce this Popiſh errour, that the true and liuely faith, and the ſanctifying ſpirit
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21168:51"/>may be in the reprobate, and that the ſame liuelie faith &amp; quickening grace may be wholie put out for a time in the elect. It may bee demanded that ſeeing the word of God is ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that men are to reſiſt the diuel ſtedfaſt in the faith, as being fully aſſured that he which hath once attained the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith can neuer be ouercome nor periſh: what ſhuld be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe that ſome do hold that true faith &amp; the ſpirit of adoption may be had &amp; loſt again? What ſhould caſt them vpon ſuch rocks, or driue them into ſuch abſurdities? Surely they be driuen into theſe while they do (as they ſuppoſe) eſchue more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous rocks &amp; greater abſurdities. They would haue it to be ſomwhat in mans own wil &amp; power to receiue faith &amp; the whole work of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They wold haue it be in the power &amp; wil of man to retain the ſame faith &amp; ſanctifying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; to loſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Why are they of that mind? Is it becauſe they enuy, that god ſhuld haue the whole praiſe &amp; glory of mans ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as man being not able to doe any thing, the grace is wholy of God? We cannot ſay ſo. But it is another thing that dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them hereunto: &amp; that is this they take it that vnles it be in mans wil &amp; power to receiue and to retain faith, it wil follow from an higher cauſe, &amp; that is this: namely that ſuch as God hath choſen vnto life, to thoſe he giueth faith &amp; worketh in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his ſpirit the new birth. Then the other ſort (if there be no power in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not attain to the faith &amp; regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they be before ordained vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil it follow that there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21168:51"/>eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an eternal decree of God, by which he hath choſen and ordained ſome to life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and appointed others to eternall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This doctrine they ſay chargeth God with iniuſtice &amp; with crueltie. For what is more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell then of purpoſe to create and make any of his workes or creatures to be condemned vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments? Where is then (ſay they) the infinit mercie, iuſtice and goodneſſe of God? To charge the Lorde God with any crueltie or iniuſtice, is moſt wicked, blaſphemous and abominable. And therefore they hold this the moſt ſafe courſe for the defence of the iuſtice and mercy of God, where the word of God ſpeaketh of election, to take it thus, that GOD hath choſen vnto life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall all thoſe whome he did foreſee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the faith, walke in obedience and continue to the end, and ſo their faith, good works and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance which God foreſaw, is the cauſe that mooued the Lord to chooſe them. On the other ſide, that he hath not reprobate any, but hee hath foreſeene that they either woulde not receiue the faith at al, or els after they haue receiued it, of their owne wickednes fall from it vtterly and finally, and ſo he hath before ordained them in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge vnto damnation. This they ſay ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with reaſon, the other they hold to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reaſon. What ſhall we ſay to this? ſhall wee heere enter for to diſcourſe at large by the ſcriptures touching election and reprobation? I haue no ſuch purpoſe. But only ſo farre as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21168:52"/>with our preſent matter, namely to make it appeare, that the ſtedfaſtneſſe of our faith, and the full aſſurance of our ſaluation, dependeth vpon the knowledge of our election. As namely, if wee finde in vs the true and liuely faith, which goeth with the ſpirit of ſanctification, wee may then riſe vp to that high cauſe, and be aſſured that the Lord hath in that his eternall and vnchangeable decree choſen vs in Chriſt to be his children, ſo that wee cannot periſh.</p>
               <p>To come then to an anſwere to thoſe men: Is not this a ſtrange thing, that they will compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend by reaſon how God could decree the choiſe or election of ſome of his creatures vnto life, and the reprobation of others vnto eternall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their ſinnes, and yet not vniuſt? If wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage the ſentence of the Apoſtle, <hi>But who art thou O man that pleadeſt with God?</hi> They aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that they doe not pleade with God, but they ſtand for the defence of the iuſtice and mercie of God, leaſt that ſhuld be imputed vnto him which is vniuſt and cruell. No? Is not this to plead with God, or againſt God. when hee ſhall bee iuſt, hee ſhall be good, hee ſhall bee mercifull, no further than thy reaſon can comprehend? He muſt yeeld a reaſon vnto thy vnderſtanding and capacitie, with what right or equitie he could doe ſo, or ſo, or els thou wilt reiect it? Is not this I ſay, to plead againſt God? Saint Paule after hee hath diſputed of the reiecting of the Iewes, and the calling in of the Gentiles, breaketh foorth into this exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21168:52"/>
                  <hi>O the deepneſſe of the riches both of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge of God: how vnſearchable are his iudgments and his wayes paſt finding out!</hi> Rom. 11. To this agreeth the Prophet in the Pſalm, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thy iudgments are as the great deep.</hi> Let it be demanded, what iudgementes of God are thoſe which be vnſearchable, or which bee as the great deep? Are they not thoſe iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth vpon his creatures, and eſpecially vpon his chief creatures, Angels and men? If theſe his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be as the great deep, euen vnſearcheable &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible both vnto men and Angels, then is it ſo in the higheſt matter, namely that hee hath ordained by his eternall decree to beſtow eternall life and glory vpon ſome, and to appoint other ſome vnto eternal ignominie &amp; torments, which they ſhall endure iuſtly for their ſinnes: For if any iudgementes of God bee vnſearcheable, or any where, it is in predeſtination. It may bee rightlie ſaid, that if the counſels, and wayes, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God be not vnſearchable in that eternal decree; then is there no iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god vnſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: which is to denie not only the ſaying of the Apoſtle and of the Prophet, but alſo after a ſort to denie God, for he that will make his iudgmentes to be ſearchable, maketh alſo God himſelfe to be ſearchable. Wilt thou meaſure and comprehend the counſels, the decrees, and the iudgementes of God by reaſon? Then meaſure and comprehend God himſelfe, euen that eternall and infinit maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, with thy reaſon. Nowe if it bee ſo, that God
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21168:53"/>hath choſen ſome for this cauſe that he did foreſee that of their owne wil and power they would be faithfull, do good works &amp; continue to the ende. And on the other ſide, that hee did foreſee who would be vnfaithfull, wicked, and rebellious euen to their death, and thoſe in his foreknowledge he ſaw to be iuſtly damned. Here is nothing incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible in theſe iudgmentes. For thy reaſon doth find out, and thy vnderſtanding doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all cauſes, and thou canſt ſhew a reaſon how God hath done euery thing, and yet is iuſt: yea all the cauſes of his counſelles he open vnto thee, if it bee ſo. Why then did Saint Paule crie out, <hi>How vnſearchable are his iudgments!</hi> Why ſaith the Prophet alſo, <hi>That they be a great deepe?</hi> The Prophet was dull of conceipt (it ſeemeth) and ſo was Paule: for thou haſt entred into this great deepe, and haſt with the light of thy reaſon ſearched out all things, and whatſoeuer is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the ſame thy reaſon, thou doubteſt not to daſh it out of Gods decrees. Thou wilt haue nothing to ſtand higher then thy reaſon can reach vnto and comprehende. Thou ſaieſt that whatſoeuer is contrarie vnto reaſon is abſurde. Well, but take heede that thou doeſt not extoll reaſon too much. It doth indeed comprehend the principles of logicke: but that it will from thence riſe vp to comprehend God, and his eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, it is extreame folly. If wee looke a little in particulars, we ſhall find it to bee ſo. VVe do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and confeſſe that the Lord God by his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21168:53"/>power &amp; infinit wiſedom created heauen &amp; earth, &amp; al things which are in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both viſible &amp; inuiſible. Of the inuiſible creatures in heauen, the Angels, ſome ſinned &amp; fel, whom he hath conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto eternall fire: they be now diuels. Others (whom the holie Apoſtle calleth the elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) neuer ſinned, neither ſhall euer any of them ſinne, as they bee well aſſured, but ſhall remaine verie glorious and bleſſed for euer.</p>
               <p>Tell me nowe, were not all theſe the creatures of God, and created in the ſame eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? How commeth it that ſome of them ſtand, &amp; others do fall? Will ye not ſay that of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſſe and loue, hee had decreed to ſtay vp the one parte, ſo that they ſhould neuer ſinne, nor be in danger of falling: and that he had alſo decreed to leaue thoſe other to their owne will and power? why did he not ſhew the ſame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and loue towards all? whie did he ſet ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious creatures in ſuch eſtate, as that they ſhould fal from the heauenlie glory into diuels torments? was he not able to ſupport them, and to retaine them in glory with the reſt? He created man in great dignitie, euen after his owne image; whie did he not keepe him in that eſtate? why did hee ſuffer the diuell to enter in vnto the woman and to tempt her? why did hee not forewarn the man and the woman, that ſuch an enemie woulde ſet vpon them? or why did he not giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrength to get the victorie in that te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation? O wilt thou ſay, God did only ſuffer thoſe thinges to bee done
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21168:54"/>by the diuell: hee did not ordaine that any ſuch matter ſhould fall out: for that cannot ſtand with equity or iuſtice: it agreeth not with mercy. Wel, thou haſt a childe, and when it is in thy power to let, yet thou wittinglie doeſt ſuffer a terrible Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enter in vnto him and to deuour him: who will ſay that this is a ſufficient excuſe to cleer thee from crueltie: to ſay that thou didſt not decree it, but onlie ſuffer it to come ſo to paſſe? If this bee no excuſe to defend thee, how fooliſh art thou in vſing it to defende the iuſtice and mercie of God? VVilt thou thus call the iuſtice of God and his mercie vnder the account of thy reaſon, that thou maiſt by thine owne wit comprehend it, or els it cannot bee iuſtice? O howe much better is it that thou ſhouldeſt crie out with the Apoſtle, <hi>How vnſearchable are his iudgmentes!</hi> And where thou canſt not comprehend by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon howe God ſhoulde in iuſtice either decree or ſuffer the fall of Angels and men; yet to reſt in this, that howſoeuer wee cannot comprehende thoſe thinges, yet we are ſure that there can be no vnrighteouſnes with God: but whatſoeuer he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth, it is moſt holie and iuſt, for his will is the perfect rule of all righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>To proceede, when man was fallen, and had caſt himſelfe and all his poſterity into endleſſe miſerie, a redeemer is promiſed. All are loſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, there be none which are in themſelues bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or more worthy than other, why then is not the redeemer ſent vnto all? If any ſhall replie and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21168:54"/>ſay hee was ſent vnto all: that is vntrue: for God choſe the ſeede of Abraham, the nation of the Iewes, he ſeparated them from al other nations of the world, he gaue them his lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, euen the liuelie Oracles for to teach them. The other nations he left in the darke, to walke in the vanities of their owne minde, ſubiect to the manifold illuſions and ſleightes of diuelles, and that for manie ages together, among whome there were ſo manie famous wiſe men, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Poets and Orators. Yea there were among them infinit thouſand thouſands which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hear of Chriſt, &amp; of infants dying and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their natiue corruption, that is, in originall ſinne. Who can ſearch out and comprehend the iudgmentes of God in this? were they not the worke of his handes? Yet there is no hope offred vnto them. But at the length Chriſt Ieſus, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light and ſaluation of the worlde, is preached to the Gentiles. Why did hee not now open the eies of all? whie did he not giue that effectuall grace of his ſpirit vnto all as to beleeue in his ſon vnto ſaluation? VVhen hee opened the heart of Lydia, why did he not alſo open the heartes of the reſt that heard Paule preach? Some will ſay they would not. Yea but hee of thoſe that were moſt vnwilling made willing where it pleaſed him: As we haue a perfect example in Saint Paule, who was a cruell perſecuter. Chriſt ſaith, No man commeth vnto me, except the father which ſent me draw him. Ioh. 6. VVhy did hee not drawe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21168:55"/>Herode, and Pilate and the high Prieſtes, as well as Paule? VVee ſee in theſe latter dayes that there be great Nations, as the weſt Indies, which had neuer hearde of Chriſt vntill of late time, and then by a moſt cruell and idolatrous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which haue murthered them moſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſo that they haue been made to ſtumble and to bee further from Chriſt. VVho is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the depth of theſe iudgementes? Shall not wee lay downe the pride of our owne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſay with the Apoſtle, Hath not the Potter power ouer the claie, of the ſame lumpe to make one veſſell vnto honour and an other vnto diſhonour? Or ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Whie haſt thou made me thus? O beloued, let vs lay aſide all ſuch vaine and curious preſumptions: and let vs, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture directeth vs make our ſingular comfort of that eternall decree of God. Thus wee are with it to fortifie our ſelues againſt the Diuell. God of his owne good will hath choſen in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, euen before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the worlde were laide, thoſe whome he will ſaue, as the heires of eternall glorie. Hee hath in his prefixed time redeemed them, not with golde or precious ſtones, (as Saint Peter ſaith) but with the blood of his ſonne, as of a Lambe immaculate and without ſpot. He doth alſo call them, hee doth ſanctifie them. This decree of God is vnchangeable, it is vnpoſsible that any of his elect ſhould periſh. VVho can
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21168:55"/>plucke them out of the handes of Chriſt? Then in the next place wee are to bee aſſured that none can haue the true faith but the choſen of God. Not any doe receiue the ſpirit of adoption which witneſſeth to their ſpirit that they be the children of God, but the elect. The elect are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie regenerate and borne of God, and ſealed with the holie ſpirit of promiſe.</p>
               <p>Then come downe to thy ſelfe: If thou canſt trulie ſay, I haue the liuelie faith, I haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption, which doth witneſſe with my ſpirit that I am the childe of God: I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, I haue the true repentance, I am ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: Satan doth tempt mee ſtronglie manie wayes, but I am ſure, though he often as it were ſoile mee, and cauſe me to goe awrie, that hee ſhall neuer get the victorie ouer mee. Is not this a ſingular comfort to a man? If anie that hath the ſpirit of adoption may loſe him: then where is the ſtedfaſtneſſe of faith which Saint Peter heere requireth, in reſiſting the Diuel? If it come once to lie in our ſelues, wee cannot bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie ſure and ſtedfaſt: wee may well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and doubt: but when we knowe that we are kept by the power of God, as it is written, 1. Pet. 1. Then haue wee a rocke whereon to reſt: then doe we ſtand ſtedfaſt armed with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God.</p>
               <p>This faith may be tried, and ſeeme oftentimes to be ſore ſhaken, but it can neuer bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21168:56"/>Yea, will ſome man ſay, but euery man cannot come to knowe that hee hath receiued the true and liuely faith, or the ſpirit of adoption, we ſee many goe farre in the profeſsion of the goſpel, and thinke that they haue the true faith, and the ſanctifying ſpirit, which yet fall quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. It is true that there bee manie which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpell and profeſſe it with ſuch feeling that they ſuppoſe God hath called them as his children: there is for the time ſuch a touch &amp; ſuch a moouing in their heartes, and yet in time they manifeſt themſelues not to be of God. One oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or other driueth them awrie, ſo that ſome of them become heretickes, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although they fall not into hereſies, yet they fall into vices, and become ſo irreligious, that all the former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which they had taſted of, doe vaniſh and are loſt. And this is the cauſe we are willed by Saint Peter to make our calling and election ſure. For ſeeing the reprobate receiue a kinde of faith and zeale, which yet is not the true and liuely faith, we are willed to be diligent and carefull to ſee that we reſt not in that faith. VVe muſt labour to attain to that teſtimonie of the ſpirit of adoption: we muſt ſeek to bee confirmed and euen ſealed with the holie ſpirit of promiſe, and ſo come to that full aſſurance of faith and hope which neuer confoundeth. And that is it which Saint Peter teacheth the way to come vnto, in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleadged, where he willeth vs to ioine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21168:56"/>with our faith, with vertue knowledge, &amp;c. For if we follow that rule which hee there preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, we ſhall be ſure neuer to fall, we ſhall then with a ſtedfaſt faith reſiſt our aduerſarie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and get the victorie ouer him. It is a matter of great importance, I pray and beſeech you, as you tender the happy eſtate of your owne ſoules, looke vnto it. Set your hearts vpon the liuelie O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of God, and ſeeke day and night after the knowledge of holie thinges, and howe to pleaſe the Lord your God. Then ſhall you bee bleſſed for euermore, Amen.</p>

               <p>BEfore we begin to handle or to intreat of the wordes of this text, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to note to whom and when this Epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21168:57"/>Concerning the firſt of theſe, it appeareth by the 3. chap. and 1. verſe, that it was written vnto the ſame that the former epiſtle was. For thus hee ſpeaketh. This ſecond Epiſtle I write vnto you, beloued, in which I ſtir vp your ſincere mind; by putting you in remembrance now theſe were the Iewes which were ſcattred abroad in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſperſion through diuers countries, as it is expreſſed in the firſt chapter of the former Epiſtle: for the Iewes were ſpecially his charge, as the care of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles was committed vnto Paul. Galat. 2.7.8. The words are theſe: When they ſaw that the goſpell of the vncircumciſion was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to me, as the goſpel ouer the circumciſion was vnto Peter: for hee that was mightie by Peter in the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ouer the circumciſion, was alſo mighty by me towards the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, this epiſtle was written by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his extreame age, when hee had euen fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his courſe, and was ready to lay downe his tabernacle, as he ſpeaketh here in the 14. verſe. As for the occaſions which moued him to write, they ſhall appeare in the particular handling of the matters.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now let vs come to the words of the Text, the 1. verſe hath two members: In the former he ſetteth foorth his own dignitie, that he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a ſetuant of God, but a principall ſeruant, and one which commeth vnto them as the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of God, to the ende that they might knowe that they had to do with God, and not with men,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21168:58"/>and ſo ſubmit themſelues to the doctrine and meſſage which hee brought, for whatſocuer God ſpake by the Apoſtles, he ſo guided their tongue and penne by his Spirit, that nothing which they ſpake or wrote, was their owne, but altogether his. In the ſecond member, hee ſetteth foorth the dignitie which thoſe to whome hee writ had with himſelfe: in theſe words, <hi>To thoſe which haue obtained the like precious faith with vs:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, Although I bee aboue you in the Apoſtolical dignitie and function, yet you are equall with me and with the reſt of the Apoſtles in the chiefe and principall dignitie, and in that wherein all happineſſe doth conſiſt, euen our precious faith. Heere it may be demaunded, how Saint Peter can aſcribe vnto them a faith equall or like precious with his owne, ſeeing hee did ſo farre excell them in giftes and graces, as in knowledge, and ſtrength of faith? The anſwere is eaſie enough, namelie, that this compariſon is not made in the meaſure and quantitie of faith, for therein ſome haue excelled others far, becauſe GOD doth not giue his giftes to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: but in the effect, which is the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſt with all his merites, which the weake faith doth as well as the ſtrong, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this reſpect is equally precious. This I ſpeake, not to make any ſlouthfull, when as the Scriptures doe pricke vs forwarde ſo much to ſeeke increaſe of faith, but for the comfort and hartening of the weake, which feeling their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21168:58"/>infirmitie and weakneſſe of faith, if it were not for this which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, might doubt whether they were partakers of the ſame happineſſe with them: now hearing this, they may bee well aſſured although their faith ſhould bee but as a graine of muſtard-ſeed, yet if it bee true faith it coupleth them to Chriſt, &amp; maketh them partakers of redemption, to haue their ſins waſhed away in his blood of righteouſneſſe, to bee couered with his obedience of life, to bee heires of the kingdome of glorie, as well as the faith of Peter, or any other. Vnto this is alſo ioyned that wherein the ſtableneſſe of this their faith doth ſtande, as vpon a ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen the righteouſneſſe of GOD, and of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And indeede the building of faith is ſo waightie, and the frame ſo heauie, that it can ſtand vpon no other foundation but this, that is to ſay, the righteouſneſſe, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or trueth of GOD which cannot lie. For if wee would perſwade a man to beleeue by this reaſon, that the thing which wee ſpeake, is that which hath beene taught by diuers men of great learning and ſingular godlineſſe: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee knowe that all men are lyers, except wee be fure that the thinges which they ſpeake be thoſe which God hath ſpoken, we ſhall ſtill wauer, and our faith ſhall bee no faith, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can reſt in the authoritie of God, and not of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond verſe containeth his ſalutation,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21168:59"/>euen that which is common to him with Paul, &amp; the other Apoſtles: wiſhing grace and peace, to thoſe vnto whome they write. And this they doe, becauſe it is the chiefe ſcope and principall end of their miniſterie, to bring men againe into Gods fauour, and to be reconciled vnto him. Of this thing ſpeaketh S. Paule, 2. Cor, 5.18. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, All things are of God, which hath reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs to himſelfe by Ieſus Chriſt, and hath giuen vnto vs the miniſterie of reconciliation, for God was in Chriſt, and reconciled the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not imputing their ſinnes vnto them: and hath committed vnto vs the word of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now then are we Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you through vs, wee pray you in Chriſt his ſteed, that you be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God. This being the chiefe end of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, cauſeth them ſo earneſtly to wiſh it for the people: and to bee ſo ſerious, not onely in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them this generallie, but alſo pointing out as it were with the finger, the way to the ſame: and that not only in their doctrine, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in their liues. Whoſoeuer digreſſeth or caſteth his eies aſide from this mark and end of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, ceaſeth to be the Miniſter of Chriſt. As for example, If he preach the Goſpel to purchaſe renow me, eſtimation, wealth, or eaſe, to himſelfe, and not to ſeeke this reconciliation betweene God and men, and to haue grace and peace mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied vpon them, he may wel ſometimes preach the truth, but not trulie.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:21168:59"/>
               <p>Likewiſe thoſe parentes which ſet foorth their children to learning, with this minde: My ſonne ſnall, liue an eaſie and merie life, hee ſhall get ſome liuinges, promotions and dignities in the Church, doe lay acorrupt and rotten foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and haue not learned this doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and therfore the building followes agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablie: for the moſt, when they come to haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not forgetting this leſſon which they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of their fathers, doe become greedy cathers of benefices and promotions, rather then careful feeders of the flock of Chriſt. But heere it may be obiected, how the Apoſtle can wiſh that grace which is the free fauour of God, ſhould bee mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied vpon them, ſeeing that Gods loue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour doth not increaſe nor diminiſh, but hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and fauoureth alwayes alike, being ſubiect to no alteration or change? This may well bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that Saint Peter doth not ſpeake heer of grace, as it is in it ſelfe in God towards men: but of their feeling the ſame, which groweth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from leſſe to greater, and becauſe it is a thing ſo precious, the Apoſtle wiſheth that it may be multiplyed vpon them. Hee expreſſeth the meane to be the knowledge and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of God, and of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>According as his diuine power hath giuen vnto vs all things that pertaine vnto life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, through the acknowledging of him that hath called vs vnto glorie and vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:21168:60"/>
               <p>This is fitly ioyned to the former verſe, to ſhew that the aboundance of grace and peace is not without cauſe required at our handes, as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhuld ſay, You are not to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your ſelues with a ſcant meaſure of Gods giftes and graces, ſeeing that there is offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and ſet foorth in Chriſt, vnto whom you may reſort as to a ſtorehouſe fullie furniſhed with all treaſures, all thinges which pertaine to life and godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee haue to obſerue in this verſe, when hee ſaith that all thinges are giuen vnto vs by his diuine power, that heere is nothing left in the worke of our ſaluation vnto our ſelues: ſo that it muſt needs follow, that theſe which defend free wil, do not ſpeak with the ſame Spirit, which the Apoſtle doeth heere. For ſetting foorth a contrarie doctrine to this, it muſt needes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from a contrarie ſpirit. The Apoſtle doth not ſay heere, that all thoſe thinges which wee want, through the weakneſſe of our nature, ſhal bee ſupplied, but to ſhew that there is nothing in vs at all, but that wee are quite ſtript of all thinges which pertaine to life and godlineſſe, He ſpeaketh not of repairing or helping in ſome part, but of a whole and free gift in euerie part: when hee ſaith without exception that all things are giuen vnto vs by the diuine power which pertaine vnto life, and godlineſſe: and ſo this doctrine doeth challenge all the praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our ſaluation to God alone.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:21168:60"/>
               <p>Thirtllie, it may bee demaunded whie the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould ſay that all thinges are giuen vnto vs by the diuine power or godhead of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, when it is manifeſt that we fetcht all thinges from his manhood: and therefore he ſaith in the ſixt chapter of Saint Iohn, verſe 46. <hi>I am that bread of life.</hi> And againe in the 54. verſe of that ſame chapter, He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood I will raiſe him vp in the laſt day: For my fleſh is meate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and my blood is drinke indeede. By this it is manifeſt, that life is giuen vnto the worlde by the manhoode of Chriſt. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is eaſie, that Chriſt in his manhood is a creature, and therefore hath nothing of his owne, but whatſoeuer is in him, as to bee the life of the worlde, and the light of men, and to haue in him all the treaſures of wiſedome: This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the Diuine nature, which dwelleth in him bodilie, as Saint Paule ſpeaketh. Now the cauſe why all theſe are put into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt, is that from thence wee may bee partakers of them: for ſo long as they haue reſidence onelie in GOD, wee are ſo farre remooued from him that by no meanes wee can approach or come neere vnto him to drawe out of him anie droppe of the ſame. Therefore though all thinges bee giuen vs by this meanes, that GOD hath put them into the fleſh of Chriſt, and ſo is come downe neere vnto vs, that wee may lay faſt holde of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21168:61"/>him: yet neuertheleſſe becauſe the propriety of them remaineth ſtill in the diuine nature, the gift of them is heere aſcribed vnto the power thereof.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, we are to note in this verſe, that the Apoſtle doth brieflie ſet downe the end and ſum of religion, and of all theſe giftes, when he ſaith, <hi>which pertaine to life and godlineſſe:</hi> for in theſe two wordes, vnto which the other two doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which are ſet downe in the latter end of the verſe, <hi>glorie and vertue,</hi> all thoſe giftes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. For that which hee expreſſed firſt by <hi>life,</hi> heere by <hi>glorie:</hi> that which before he called <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> heere he calleth <hi>vertue:</hi> they are as much as to ſay, eternall felicitie, and life with glorie, &amp; the way which wee muſt paſſe through to the ſame, which is godlineſſe and vertue. Heere wee are to take great heede, that wee doe not ſeuer or ſunder thoſe thinges which the Lord himſelfe hath ſo neerly coupled and linked together. And this admonition is ſo much the more neceſſarie, becauſe there are very many carnall profeſſours and beaſtlie abuſers of Chriſtianitie, which doe ſeeme verie willinglie and gladly to imbrace the promiſes of the Goſpel, concerning redemption and eternall life purchaſed in Chriſt Ieſus: and they make great boaſt that they looke for their part in the ſame as wel as any other, and yet they looke nothing at all to this godlineſſe and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, through which wee muſt paſſe vnto it, for God hath not called vs, but as he ſaith heere, <hi>to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21168:61"/>glorie and vertue,</hi> ſo that whomſoeuer the Lord hath called to knowe him aright, and ſo to bee made heires of eternall glorie, he hath alſo garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them with vertues and graces of the ſpirite of ſanctification. Vntill ſuch time therefore, as there ſhall riſe vp a new Peter, which with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie pen ſhall write a new and contrary Goſpel, theſe men ſhall neuer aſſure themſelues, nor yet perſwade others that they ſhall euer come to the kingdome of God, ſeeing they goe a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie way.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Whereby most great and precious promiſes are giuen vnto vs, &amp;c.</hi> Now he ſheweth by what means or by what inſtruments the diuine power doth beſtow thoſe giftes vpon vs, and the ſame are as hee calleth them, moſt great and precious promiſes which are giuen vnto vs, whereby wee are called to glorie and vertue, as hee ſpeaketh in the former verſe: theſe are called moſt great and precious, becauſe the thinges which are offered vnto vs in the Goſpell of Chriſt, for greatnes and dignitie are incomparable. For what can wee ſeeke out to match with this that heere is offered vnto vs? namelie, the remiſſion of our ſinnes in the blood of his ſonne, deliuerance and freedome from the thraldome of Satan and power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that of damned creatures and children of his wrath, he hath giuen vs this high dignitie to be his ſonnes and daughters: and as S. Iohn ſaith, Reuel. 1. Chriſt hath waſhed vs in his blood, and made vs Kinges and Prieſtes to God his father:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21168:62"/>what a change is this, from the loweſt miſerie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the gulfe of hell, to be lifted vp to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dignitie, to be glorified with God in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen? Becauſe therefore theſe things are the greateſt and moſt honorable, Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calleth the promiſes of the Goſpel, moſt great and precious. But wherefore doth the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all to the doctrine of the Goſpel? for when he ſaith, that by theſe wee are made partakers of the diuine nature, he includeth all. Becauſe it is by the Goſpell that wee are called home to the Lord: for although he vtter his will vnto vs in his Lawe, yet therein hee ſheweth himſelfe none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe vnto vs, but as a ſeuere Iudge, wee can ſee nothing there, but the dreadfull curſe and vengeance of eternall fire: his brightneſſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth therein, but we bee not able to beholde the ſame, but are dazeled with the ſight thereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed and confounded, ſo that wee cannot but runne from him, becauſe there is nothing but that which is terrible. Contrariwiſe, in the Goſpell, hee hath reuealed himſelfe in the face of his ſonne, where hee ſheweth an exceeding glorie, but with ſuch fatherlie loue and pitie, ſuch abundance of mercie, and ſweet allurements, by which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs and draweth vs to himſelfe: that heer wee are able to looke vpon him with open face, and heere his countenance is ſo cheerefull, that the ſoule which hath once, with the cie of faith ſeene but a glimſe thereof is ſo inflamed and rauiſhed with deſire of a neerer and fuller ſight, that it can
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21168:62"/>neuer be ſatisfied. For this cauſe Saint Paule ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king compariſon betweene the miniſterie of the Law and the miniſterie of the Goſpell, 2. Cor. 3. tearmeth that the miniſtration of death, and the letter which killeth; and this the miniſtration of the ſpirit which giueth life. Which by the way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is to bee obſerued, becauſe there bee at this day among vs many frantike brains: namely thoſe of the Family of loue, which cal the true &amp; ſound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting of the word, the literal ſenſe, or the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which killeth, and their owne groſſe and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh allegories the ſpirit: not knowing that Saint Peter ſpeaketh of the difference betweene the Lawe, and the Goſpell. Heere alſo appeareth of what price and dignitie the Goſpell is: for who can ſet foorth the worthineſſe of this, when hee ſaith, that by theſe promiſes we are made partakers of the diuine nature. We were indeed at the firſt created after the image of GOD, and ſo partakers of his nature: but wee loſt all this with our firſt parentes, and in ſteed thereof wee were made partakers of the diueliſh nature, bearing his image, and fulfilling his luſtes. Now by faith in the Goſpell, this image is reſtored and built vp in vs againe, whileſt we receiue the ſpirite of ſanctification ioyned with the ſame. If men did knowe this firſt, that all happineſſe in men is to bee made partakers of the nature of God, and to communicate with him: and then that this is wrought onely by the Goſpell: men woulde not ſo lothſomelie deſpiſe it, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21168:63"/>preferre euery light commodity, &amp; trifling plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure before it: men would not ſeeke to diſgrace and ſlander it: men would not be ſo ſoone wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in hearing of it, nor thinke euerie houre tenne, while they be at it. Finally men, vnleſſe they were mad men, would not as they do now almoſt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where, thinke themſelues beſt at eaſe when it is furtheſt from them: for who would willinglie throwe himſelfe headlong to deſtruction? who would ſo play the mad beaſtes, as to thruſt God from them, and refuſe to bee made partakers of his heauenlie nature? which all they doe, that haue as yet felt no ſweetneſſe in the Goſpell, or at leaſt haue ſo little taſted that it can ſcarſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine colde loue at their hands. But there needeth ſomewhat to bee ſaid vpon the phraſe of ſpeech which Saint Peter vſeth, for it is ſomewhat harde to ſome, and as it was in olde time foully abuſed by Heretikes, ſo is it wickedly at this day peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the louelie Familie, which holding this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that men are deified, and God is homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as their language is, meaning that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie eſſence and ſubſtance of God is transfuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and his ſubſtance and theirs mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, take great holde of this, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are made partakers of the diuine nature.</hi> But you ſhal ſee that euery ſimple man may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie confute them: if we aske what the nature of an horſe is, will a man anſwer that he is made of the earth: then a horſe and a man are both of one nature, forman is alſo made of the earth: It is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21168:63"/>manifeſt then that none is ſo fooliſh but hee will confeſſe, that when we ſpeake of the nature of any thing, we meane not the ſubſtance, but the qualities and properties: euen ſo in this place we muſt needs graunt, that by the diuine nature in this place is nothing els meant, but that there ſhuld be ſuch a nature and ſuch qualities in men, as may carie a reſemblance of the diuine nature: as for example, God is holie, we muſt bee holie, he is pure, good, iuſt, gracious, bountifull, louing and mercifull, all theſe and ſuch like muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in vs: wee ſhall alſo come to bee partakers of life, of glorie, of ioy, of happineſſe, and eternitie, and ſo in a neerer ſort to bee partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature: What are all thoſe now the better, which haue ſo receiued the precious promiſes, that their qualities are euen as agreeable to the nature of God, as light is with darkneſſe, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with Hell, or Chriſt with Beliall? Sith ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſhamefull and beaſtlie ſinnes, flow &amp; raigne in them, which are ſo manie partakinges of the Diueliſh nature, let them for ſhame denie that they haue ought wherin they communicate with God, in anie thing ſauing a bare profeſſion. Then what is it which maketh a good man? The promiſes of the Goſpell. What is it which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth life and ſaluation? The Goſpell. Who are they which haue imbraced the promiſes, &amp; haue the true and liuely faith? The holy. Who are they whom God hath called to life eternall, to bee thoſe whome he loueth as children, bearing his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21168:64"/>Image? The pure and vndefiled. In the laſt clauſe of this verſe he ſheweth his meaning very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <hi>In that,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>yee flee the corruptions which are in the world through luſt.</hi> This is the way to bee made partakers of the diuine nature, for as corruptions and filthie defilinges the more they cleaue vnto vs, the more they ſeparate vs from the Lord: ſo contrariwiſe, the more a man doth flie and eſchewe them, ſo much the neerer hee doth approch vnto God, who is the fountaine of all puritie. VVee are heere to note that Saint Peter maketh all corruption and naughtineſſe in the worlde to ſpring out of concupiſcence: or as it is vſuallie tranſlated, Luſt: where wee muſt learne firſt, what this concupiſcence or luſt is, which is heere ſayd to bee as it were the ſeate of ſinne, and indeede it is the roote and fountaine out of which groweth and floweth all euill that is committed in the worlde, either in thought, word, or deed: to bee ſhort, this is that which is forbidden in the tenth commandement, when he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet:</hi> at leaſt ſo much of it is forbidden there, as pertaineth to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, that is the roote and fountaine of all euill againſt men, for there is nothing recited in the ſame laſt commaundement, but towarde men: and when our Sauiour Chriſt ſetteth foorth the ſumme of the firſt Table, he ſaith it is to loue the Lord with all the heart, withall the ſoule, &amp;c. Now where the whole heart is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there concupiſcence muſt needes be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21168:64"/>but yee will ſay, what is it? wherein doth it conſiſt? It is not in deeds, wordes, nor thoughts, but a more cloſe and inwarde ſickneſſe, bred as they ſay in the bones, the naturall blot and ſpot of originall ſinne, which we haue by inheritance from our firſt parentes, and bring with vs out of our mothers womb, out of which al euil thoughts and deſires doe ariſe in vs. Saint Iames in the firſt chapter of his epiſtle maketh it the wombe and mother which conceiueth and bringeth forth ſin, <hi>Let no man</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>when hee is tempted, ſay, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with euill, neither tempteth hee any man, but euerie one is tempted when hee is drawne away by his own concupiſcence, and is entiſed: then luſt when it hath conceiued, bringeth forth ſinne, and ſinne when it is finiſhed bringeth foorth death.</hi> The firſt thing we haue heere to note in this doctrine is this: that all corruption is of our ſelues, not comming from any outward cauſe: It is true that Satan is an inſtrument, and as it were the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to ſtirre and kindle in vs the luſtes of ſinne, and beareth a verie great ſtroke in the matter, but if it were not for this concupiſcence that is in vs, hee could not bring his matters to paſſe, the prouocations and allurementes of wicked men, are ſo manie meanes to driue vs and drawe vs into ſinne, but yet the cauſe is in our ſelues. A chiefe point to bee obſerued that we may lerne to condemne our ſelues when wee haue done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, and not after the maner of men, which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21168:65"/>looke when they haue faulted howe they may disburthen themſelues, and bee diſcharged of the blame, and therefore they will either crie out of the diuel, as though he, as they ſay, ought them a ſhame, or els they will ſay, woe woorth ſuch or ſuch that euer I knew them, if it had not been for them, I ſhould not haue done thus. The Prophet Dauid when he had committed murther and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, being reprooued by Nathan, although he knewe right well that the Diuell was a greate furtherer, in the matter: likewiſe he might haue thought vpon the fonde dealing of the woman, which ſo vndiſcreetlie waſhed her ſelfe in ſuch a place as others might ſee her: yet he letteth theſe go, and to the end he may wholy and fullie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne himſelfe, hee looketh home to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of all this foule and beaſtlie ſinne, &amp; ſaith, <hi>Behold I was borne in wickednes, and in ſinne hath my mother conceiued mee:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: O Lord, I cannot ſeeke any way to be excuſed, for all this rebellion againſt thee, is conceiued and bred in mine owne corrupt breaſt, I brought the roote of it from my mothers wombe. This is a good leſſon for vs to learne: for ſo long as we do not know it, but like partiall and corrupt iudges go about to excuſe our ſelues, &amp; to rid our hands of that we haue committed, we ſhall neuer come to any ſincere repentance. Further, wee are heere to obſerue in this place, that all corruption com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from this luſt, if we will repent indeed, wee muſt begin heere. For if they be changed only in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21168:65"/>their outwarde deedes and wordes, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſickenes not healed, they haue gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no more then a man which would deſtroy a tree, and doth no more then lop and ſhred off certain boughes and twigs, leauing the ſtumpe and roote behinde: for ſo long as this doeth liue in them, they may well ſeeme in the eies of men, to be very great conuertes, if they of ignorant idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otes, are become ſuch as haue gotten ſome skill and knowledge: from drunkards, ruffians, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and ſuch like, they become ſober, modeſt, and of good behauiour; as this may be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and yet the heart nothing altered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: for there be many cauſes which may mooue men to ſeeme outwardly to bee godlie, when the heart within is fraught with lothſome luſtes, and ful of rotten corruptions, which make men ſtill altogether abominable before God. To bee ſhort therefore, a man ſhall neuer rightly iudge of himſelfe whether hee haue repented, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee looke to the bottome of this ſore, that it may bee healed. The greateſt multitude of men, being as blind as Beetles in this point, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that repentance, is a verie light and eaſie thing, which they can haue when they liſt: when a man of wiſedome ſaith this, that here lieth ſo deepe a matter, that heere bee rootes which are hard to bee pulled vp, hee is mooued to bee the more carefull, leaſt hee deceiue himſelfe. Looke therefore euery man to his thoughts, for by them is the triall made: if the thoughtes bee chaunged,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21168:66"/>and the inward deſires altered, ſo that of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and worldlie, they are become holie and heauenly: then hee may boldlie ſay, I haue a newe heart, and there is a right ſpirit renued in me, I haue repented, I haue not playd the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, I feele an vpright heart toward God, I feele the corrupt fountaine ſtopped, ſo that the filthy matter, and ſtincking mudde doeth not boile foorth as it did. It may alſo bee demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded heere, whether this luſt be not a ſinne or a corruption of it ſelfe, becauſe Saint Peter ſaith, that corruption reſteth in it. The place which I alleadged out of the 51. Pſalme, doth prooue it to be a ſinne: alſo it may bee prooued out of the fift to the Romans, where Saint Paule proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that infantes haue ſinne, becauſe they are ſubiect to death, which is the rewarde of ſinne, although, as hee ſaith, they ſinne not after the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of Adam. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee had none other but this, it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to condemne vs, and vtterly to caſt vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Let vs neuer ceaſe therefore, vntill we feele a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in our ſelues, euen in this ſecret infection, for otherwiſe wee ſhall neuer be able to flie the corruptions which are in the world, or as Saint Iames ſpeaketh in the firſt chapter of his Epiſtle, to keepe our ſelues vnſpotted of the worlde, ſo long as we carie the corrupt world in our breaſt: neither ſhall our religion bee pure, for thus it is faide, If any man among you ſeemeth religious, and refraineth not his tongue, but deceiueth his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21168:66"/>owne heart, this mans religion is vaine. Pure religion and vndefiled before God, euen the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this, to viſit the fatherleſſe and widowes in their diſtreſſe, and to keepe himſelfe vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the world.</p>

He hath declared in the former verſes, among other chiefe matters, this one eſpeciallie, to how great holineſſe and pureneſſe through ſanctification, we be called: which was chieflie expreſſed in theſe wordes, that by them yee may bee made partakers of the diuine nature, in that yee flie the corruption which is in the worlde through luſt: vnto this now he ioyneth an exhortation, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at their handes not onlie to put to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but alſo, as he ſaith, euen all diligence.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21168:67"/>For as it is the greateſt and chiefeſt thing which we are to looke after, ſo there is required at our handes, to giue our principall care and ſtudie thereunto: this equitie muſt eaſilie be graunted, that if we cannot obtaine or get the thinges of this life, which are ſmall in compariſon, vnleſſe wee put to our diligence, for God will haue it to be ſo, that then of good right, looke how much heauenly things exceed in dignitie the earthie, ſo much muſt the care &amp; diligence beſtowed vpon them exceed. How farre almoſt are all men from this doctrine both in practiſe and iudgement: firſt when we ſee the exceeding trauel and paines which they ſtick not willingly to beſtow, in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the beggerlie traſh of this worlde, either ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or honours: they will ride and run, early and late, by night and by day, by ſea and by land, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſommer, wearing out their bodies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pine and ſtarue themſelues with hunger and beating their braines with as great diligence as can be poſſible: but when it commeth to theſe thinges which Saint Peter ſpeaketh, as thinges of no price, they paſſe by them, in ſuch wiſe, that they are heere euen as ſlouthfull and careleſſe, as they are diligent in the other. For iudgement in this behalfe, if a man talke with theſe worldlie men, they will ſhewe their minde and opinion, aske them why they be ſo careful for theſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things, their anſwere is readie, we ſhall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe come ſhort of them, and go without them: and whie doe yee not ſeeke as faſt for heauenlie

Thus they ſhift off the care of godlineſſe, as though God did not require it at their hands: neuer hearing of this which Saint Peter requireth: wee muſt take heede of this, giuing eare to God, who teacheth vs this leſſon by the holy Apoſtle: for if we let this paſſe, we are moſt miſerable. Heer alſo when we are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue all diligence, appeareth plainlie how hard a thing it is to flie from corrupt luſtes: for if it were an eaſie thing to be done, leſſe diligence might ſerue: but ſinne cleaueth neere and ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth faſt in vs, and is not eaſilie ſhaken off: it is deeplie rooted, ſo that vnleſſe we digge verie deepe, wee are ſure to leaue the roots ſtil behind, which will growe and ſpring againe as faſt as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yea oftentimes ſeeming to bee dead, they ſuddainlie reuiue: ſo that wee are ſet a worke while we liue heere without anie intermiſſion, to bee ſtill toiling to pull vp theſe weedes, the ground is ſo ranke, that in a verie ſhort time it will bee whollie ouergrowne. Therefore ſuch as deſpiſe the meanes which God hath appointed, or vſe them ouer negligentlie, muſt needes haue their heart ouergrown with theſe ſtinking weeds of luſt and concupiſcence: and ſo if euer there be any good ſeed in them, as good motions or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to feare God, they are by and by cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo that they can bring foorth no fruite, or at leaſt no ripe and timelie fruit.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:21168:68"/>
               <p>But heere may bee obiected, that this agreeth not with the former ſaying, that the diuine power hath giuen vs all thinges which pertaine to life and godlineſſe, there hee aſcribeth all to God, and taketh all from vs; heere he ſeemeth to giue ſomewhat vnto our diligence, and ſo to eſtabliſh free-will in vs. We muſt anſwer heere, that God worketh all in all, and alone ſtriketh the ſtroke, yet hee doth not worke in vs, as the Carpenter or Maſon worketh vpon the log and the ſtone, which haue no feeling of that which is done vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and therefore nothing of them is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: but wee haue a will in vs and reaſon, which of themſelues being corrupt, do nothing but hinder this worke, vntill ſuch time as God hath faſhioned them a new: wee haue appetites and affections in vs, but of themſelues mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, theſe hee tameth and ſubdueth. So that this worke of God in vs, is not without a feeling of it, for hee moueth vs to will, to deſire, to ſorrow, to reioyce, and ſuch like, ſo that our diligence is required, becauſe he worketh in none but hee doth make them diligent, heere is ſtill then that which God doth beſtowe vpon vs, and not that which we haue of our ſelues. By this place all thoſe are anſwered, which cloake and defende themſelues in their naughtineſſe and ſloth in the ſeruice of God, after this maner: Wee haue that which God hath giuen vs, all men are not alike godlie, euery man cannot do as you doe: when their owne heart and conſcience doth tell euerie
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21168:68"/>of them the contrarie, ſaying, thou art careleſſe and negligent, thou haſt as much as thou deſireſt; for God doth increaſe all giftes and graces in thoſe which vſe all diligence in ſeeking after him. Let vs learne therefore, brethren, to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all thoſe thinges which are heere taught, to giue greater diligence, and ſo beate our braine more earneſtlie about heauenlie thinges, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe earthlie, to labour and trauel more for godlineſſe, then for treaſures and riches. Which if we doe, we ſhall feele increaſe of ſtrength to caſt out corrupt luſtes, although not ſo much as faine we would, yet God being true, wee ſhall haue ſo much that wee cannot faile or miſſe of our deſire. It followeth, <hi>Ioine moreouer vertue with your faith, &amp;c.</hi> Saint Peter knoweth what babes we bee, how vnable to guide our ſteppes in the pathes of godlineſſe, and that maketh him not only to mooue and perſwade to godlineſſe, but euen as it were, taking vs by the hand, and teaching vs how to tread euery ſtep, he rehearſeth particularlie the things wherein we are to trauell when hee ſaith, <hi>Ioyne moreour with your faith, vertue: with vertue, knowledge: with knowledge, temperance: with temperance, patience: with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, godlineſſe: and with godlines, brotherlie kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and with brotherlie kindnes, loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith heere is ſet in the firſt place, vnto which all the other muſt bee ioyned, becauſe without it we cannot by any meanes pleaſe God, it doth iuſtifie vs before God alone, but yet it doth not</p>

               <p>Now if we marke well, what maner of men they were to whom hee wrote, namely no babes nor yoonglinges in the Goſpell, for he ſaid they had obtained like precious faith with him, and afterwarde in this chapter hee ſaith, they did knowe and were ſtabliſhed in the preſent truth: wee ſhall eaſilie perceiue how this may ſtop the mouthes of manie, which holde blind errours. Firſt of all of thoſe, which affirme that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the mother of deuotion, if Godlineſſe and vertue bee the true deuotion, then it muſt needes followe, that their doctrine is falſe and diueliſh, ſeeing we are charged to ioyne vnto our vertue knowledge: it is true if they meane Popiſh deuotion, for they coulde neuer haue kept men in awe, to bee zealous of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ſeeke for that at the handes of men, which God alone doeth giue, vnleſſe they had kept them in blindneſſe and ignoraunce: and therefore they tooke a wiſe way, to keepe the people from knowing the word, which ſo ſoone as it brake foorth againe, diſcloſed all their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood and trecherie, in ſo much that neither good nor bad almoſt, haue anie deuotion vnto them. Secondly, of thoſe, which although they bee not ranke Papiſtes, yet haue in them ſtill, a ſmacke and ſauour of popiſh principles: and therefore like fooles, are alſo enimies vnto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For thus they ſpeake, It were no matter if there were leſſe preaching, I thinke the people bee the woorſe for it, there is knowledge euen
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21168:69"/>enough, what ſhould laie men bee troubled to learne, or to ſeeke for the knowledge of the Scriptures, let them tend their worke, and look to their occupations, and learne to be quiet, and to deale honeſtlie: Againſt theſe poore blinde beaſtes, (for I may vſe no gentle ſpeech) we are to reaſon out of this place: firſt, that all men, know they neuer ſo much, are heere commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to increaſe in knowledge, to the ende they may increaſe in faith and godlineſſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, let them conſider to what manner of men Saint Peter wrote, namely, to poore and rich men, women and children, to all ſortes, and to be ſhort, to as manie as woulde haue faith and vertue, and ſo come to life and glorie, and therefore as well the poore ploughman, as the great Clearke is commaunded to increaſe his knowledge out of Gods booke. Thirdlie, they much ouerſhoote themſelues, when they would beare them in hand, that knowledge, which is the guider of vertue, ſhould be the cauſe of vice. Nay, if we wipe our eies, and looke better to the matter, we ſhall ſee, that there is a flood of ignorance, which hath almoſt ouerwhelmed all, and in manie which ſeeme to know very much, if they were ſounded to the bottom, there ſhould be found in them groſſe ignorance, and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble darkeneſſe: and ſo indeede the true cauſe of all foule ſinnes, which abound at this day among vs, and flowe euen as a ſwelling ſea, is the want of true knowledge. This ignorance hath taken
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21168:70"/>ſuchroote, that all they which haue made proof, will confeſſe with mee, that our time is like the time of the prophet Eſay, chap. 28. who hauing laboured himſelfe as it were out of breath and teaching, and ſeeing ſo ſmall profiting, being commaunded of the Lord ſtill to goe to his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, burſteth foorth in theſe ſpeeches: Whom ſhall I teach knowledge? whom ſhall I make for to vnderſtand? them that are wained from the milke, and drawne from the breaſtes? for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept muſt bee vpon precept, precept vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, line vnto line, line vnto line, a little heere, and a little there. And in another place hee ſaith, The word of the Lord was like a ſealed booke, if hee come to one, ſaying, Reade this I pray you, he maketh anſwer, I cannot read; to another that can reade, he anſwereth, I cannot, for it is ſealed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, let thoſe ſillie creatures learne of this place to be aſhamed of that, wherein they ſeeme after a ſorte to glorie, when they vſe to ſay as they thinke in defence of themſelues, wee bee without skill, wee haue no knowledge, wee bee poore honeſt men, wee haue no learning: it is as much as to ſaye, wee haue no faith, wee haue no vertue, wee haue no godlineſſe: for wee bee plainely taught here that faith, vertue, and knowledge, muſt increaſe and growe vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Let vs all print this leſſon deepely in our mindes, that it may driue vs to make haſte to come out of our ignorance, and to ſeeke apace
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21168:70"/>after knowledge. Let vs take heede of flattering our ſelues as ſome other doe, which hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſome skill, or at leaſt thinke that they haue ſet very light by the publike teaching of the word, they doe excuſe themſelues after this ſorte, I thanke God, I am not of the ignorant ſort, nor of the meaneſt iudgement, I knowe ſomewhat, let them hunt after preaching that neede, it is very good for them, as for mee, I am ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the matter already: this kinde of men are harde too deale withall, becauſe they bee wiſe in their owne conceite, and not in the Lorde, for if they had once but euen a little taſted of true knowledge, of the ſweeteneſſe and power thereof, they would neuer haue enough of the firſt ſponefull, if they had an healthfull ſtomacke, they could neuer bee brought ſo ſoone to loath, and as it were to vomit vp againe, ſo wholeſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance. But let vs learne here, that when our knowledge is growne to bee neuer ſo great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know but in part, and we know nothing as we ought to know, as Saint Paule ſaieth, euen then we are to giue all diligence, to ioyne to our vertue, knowledge, vnleſſe when we haue begun and proceeded ſo farre, we minde to fall backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. This place doeth plainely ſet forth the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and miſerable ſtate of thoſe which be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teaching, or haue it in ſo ſcanty a meaſure, that they come almoſt to no vnderſtanding: they are merie and thinke all is well, and thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues beſt, when they are leaſt dealt withall, but
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21168:71"/>iudge righteous iudgement, which the Lord by his Apoſtle teacheth vs to iudge, and we ſhal ſee that their mirth is nothing els, but a mad laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, euen in the middeſt of fearefull and horrible deſtruction. <hi>Vnto knowledge ioyne temperance, &amp;c.</hi> Or continence, for ſo the word which Saint Peter vſeth may be tranſlated. But what doth he meane, hauing bidden vs to ioyne vertue to faith? Againe as though he had forgotten himſelfe, to expreſſe certaine ſeuerall kinds of vertues, which hee will haue vs to ioyne to the former, when as indeede, the worde <hi>Vertue</hi> containeth them all. Wee may not thinke but that hee is verie wel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, and that he knoweth with whome he hath to doe, what babes and Children we are, which muſt not haue meate ſet before vs, in groſſe to be our owne caruers, but it muſt bee minced to our handes, we muſt alſo be fedde as it were by ſpoonfuls. For this cauſe he did not contenthim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to exhort in generall vnto vertue, but alſo to name and point vs out certaine chiefe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which we muſt eſpeciallie labour about, for vnleſſe God ſhould deale with vs in this wiſe, ſo vaine are we, that wee ſhould wander and roue as it were in a wide field, and neuer come nigh the marke, or at leaſt, in looking after ſome one vertue or other, forget and let goe the chiefe and principall. For wee ſee many that can rowle in their mouth the name of vertue and godlineſſe, and nothing almoſt but vertue, vertue, as though they would perſwade men, that their garden did
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21168:71"/>growe full of ſuch hearbes, but when wee come to this particular examination, to looke for this vertue and that, in ſteede of theſe ſweet hearbes, we ſhall find nothing but ſtincking weeds. Here is a great parte of our diligence and wiſdome, therefore, that when wee ſtudie forvertue and godlineſſe, and when we call vpon the Lord for giftes, we ſearch out euery part, and branch, leaſt we be ouerſeene in ſome ſpeciall point, and leaſt while wee ſeeke to increaſe one vertue, another decay in vs, for that ſhall come to paſſe, if we caſt not our eies diligently on euerie ſide, and ſo often times we rather looſe then gaine, rather go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than forward. Out of the negligence in this point of doctrine, or for want of knowledge in it, men growe into ſecuritie, and a verie little contenteth them, yea though it be but euen ſome ſhew of vertue, and ſlouthfullie they ſhuffle off the matter: a thing greatlie to be taken heed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Becauſe, out of all queſtion it is, that which hath cauſed diuers forward men, in continuance of time as it were gathering ruſt to become ſlack: if wee haue deſire therefore to continue, let vs learne to put this leſſon in practiſe. But why doth hee will vs to ioyne temperance or continence with knowledge, it ſhould ſeeme he had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of any affinitie in matching theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, for temperance is conuerſant about plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delightes: Yes verilie, we ſhall plainly ſee, that there is great cauſe for which he ioyneth euerie one of theſe vertues togither. And firſt,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21168:72"/>to begin with this, yee are to note that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is not conuerſant alone, about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes of the body, but alſo of the minde: ſo that in ſeeking knowledge, which wee muſt doe very eagerly, wee are to take heed of theſe extreames which are contrary to a continent minde, either to bee ſo wauering, that euery puffe doe driue vs from the manifeſt truth, or elſe on the other ſide to bee ſo ſtiffe, and ſo wilfully wedded to our owne iudgement, that wee will ſtand in defence of that which we haue once liked, and not admit any reaſon to the contrary: both theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a continent minde: and both of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to true knowledge. Therefore wee are warned here in our diligent ſearch for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to take heed that when wee haue learned the truth, wee continue ſtedfaſt and vnmoueable in it, not to be toſſed to and fro, as ſome vnſtable minds are, who when they haue been taught the truth, the leaſt doubt that is rayſed againſt it, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them by and by to ſhake, and to feare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be in the right way or no, alſo wee muſt take heede of that ſtiffeneſſe, which cauſeth ſome to ſpeake when it were better for them to heare, and to bee heard aloft, when a lower voyce might ſerue them better: farre from the counſell of Saint Iames, who willeth vs to bee ſwift to heare, and ſlow to ſpeake. Let vs bee ſure our knowledge bee well grounded, before wee ſettle our ſelues to continew in it: leaſt in ſteede of heaping vp golde, wee fill our cheſtes with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21168:72"/>but droſſe. Alſo we muſt beware, that we bend our ſtudie for the knowledge of theſe points which ſerue to increaſe godlineſſe, and to true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying. For many ſeek for knowledge, but their vaine braine doth carie them to ſeeke after curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous queſtions, and to let paſſe thoſe things which ſhould do them moſt good: and this is a ſore and grieuous ſickneſſe in men, as the queſtions they commonlie mooue, doe ſhew. Hee addeth, <hi>To temperance ioyne patience.</hi> This alſo may ſeem to bee ſomewhat ſtrange; but if we looke well vnto it, wee then ſhall perceiue the meaning more plainlie: patience is not onely requiſite in thoſe which haue receiued the profeſſion of the Goſpel, to beare and indure all perſecutions and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which oftentimes are ſo raging, that (except wee haue our heartes well ſtayed, and ſeaſoned with patience) wee ſhall bee driuen to forſake and to forſwear our knowledge: but alſo it is very requiſite to be wel armed &amp; fenced with it, when wee ſhall haue to doe with thoſe which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and groſſe, and therefore it is as a dagger to a mans heart, to heare all their blockiſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the word, to ſee how ſenceleſſe they are, when the plaine trueth is laid before them: Likewiſe their ſpiteful railings &amp; fleeting mocks which they will vſe: their bold abuſing of Gods word, their arrogant preſumption, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to prattle very faſt, euen they knowe not what: or els wee ſhall be huried hither and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21168:73"/>thither vpon rockes, and make ſhipwrack of our mildneſſe, and ſo marre and diſgrace the good cauſe which we haue in hande. For wicked men will iudge all to proceede of rancour and anger, and aſcribe all to choler, and ſo by this meanes there is procured ſome diſhonour to God, who ſhould greatlie be honoured if we could meekely (as his Apoſtle willeth) inſtruct thoſe which are contrarie minded, proouing if God at anie time wil giue them repentance, to come out of the ſnare of the diuell of whom they bee holden cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, to doe his will, and ſo to ſtop their mouthes, that they cannot bee able to anſwere. The want of this vertue oftentimes bringeth great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience to the conference of brethren, which ſhould bring togither (as it were into one heap) whatſoeuer euery one hath gleaned by himſelfe, that ſo the one might ſupply y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> want of the other; but the impatience of ſome is ſuch, that great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience doth growe thereby. To conclude this matter, ſeeing troubles are allotted vnto vs, and ſuffrings for the truth, and that wee are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſo many reproches, railinges, tauntes, and mockes at the handes of abſurd and euill men: whoſoeuer looketh to walk in the way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hee muſt ſeeke to poſſeſſe his ſoule in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. It followeth, <hi>With pattence, godlines, &amp;c.</hi> A man may demaund what manner of order is heere vſed, in willing vs to ioyne godlineſſe to patience, and then to godlines, brotherlie kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21168:73"/>is not godlines the whole or the general, and theſe branches are members of it? True it is that this word is often vſed generallie, to comprehend all goodnes, but in this place, it comprehendeth but the firſt Table of the law, wherein we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be deuout or zealous: a very neceſſary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat to beware that we doe not become ſo pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that wee forget to bee zealous in the Lords quarrell: it is as if Saint Peter ſhould haue ſaide: I would not haue you ſo meeke, as to beare and put vp al, I would haue you withall to be hotte in Gods quarrell, forget not that. For many vnder a colour of a meeke patience, doe couer the want of religion, for if God bee diſhonoted, his truth defaced, his ſeruants ſlaundered, they can heare and ſee, and yet bee as meeke as a Lambe: but if themſelues bee touched yee ſhall ſee them playe the Lions, and of luke warme to become fire hot: this therefore is no patience which wanteth god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. We muſt learne then, both with patience, &amp; meeknes, to deale in the Lords matters, and alſo with feruent zeale: leaſt in ſteed of this excellent vertue of patience, which was commended vnto vs, there be nothing but a prophane vngodlineſſe and an irreligious mildnes, in which at this day moe doe offend, then through impatience: for theſe Atheiſts haue this as an excuſe very readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Are we not commaunded to be gentle and ſoft? Is it not our dutie to maintaine loue, and charitie with our neighbours? Indeede they bee great ſwearers, and ſometime they vſe to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21168:74"/>ſpeake againſt Gods worde, if they bee awry, I thinke they ſhall anſwere for themſelues, if wee ſhould gainſay, or ſeeme to reprooue them, they would not take it well, therefore I thinke good not to diſquiet them. Heere is now woonderfull patience, theſe are verie godly and charitable perſons, yea euen a treacherie towards God and men. For is there anie of them, which being ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with ſome foule crime, wherby they ſhuld receiue great iniurie, or be ſpitefully rayled vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if ſome of their neere friendes ſit by and hold their tougues, when they know they be iniuried, that cannot by and by feele &amp; ſay, this was colde friendſhip, that they could not haue dealt ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louinglie towardes their friendes, by whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they ſhould haue heard them ſo abuſed, they could not haue helde their tonges? Then belike God nor his truth are none of their deare friends that they can put vp ſuch iniurie done towardes him. There is plentie of this patience in all places, but godlineſſe cannot be ſuffered to come neere, for hee is a breake peace and a verie vnpleaſant fellowe, hee is ouer rough and preciſe, and ouer captious, there was good neighbourhood and friendſhip before he came, they could bee merie together, and bee in vnitie, without any iarre: had it not beene better to vſe gentleneſſe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, then to haue this broyle? for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better then loue, &amp; where that is not, there is nothing good. O miſerable dayes, this is the good loue now among men, that they cannot
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21168:74"/>loue one another, but they muſt hate God, to haue peace and concord with men to be at oddes with God for mens ſake, to put vp the diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his name, not to continue in patience, vnles godlines be wanting. The vngodlie world and leud nature that is in men, taketh occaſion to accuſe godlie zeale, vnder this pretence: and to finde fault with the preaching of the word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſay they, it ſetteth men at ſtrife. But wee muſt learne in this place to ioyne godlines with our patience, for otherwiſe we ſhall bee found to bee nothing els but irreligious and prophane dogs: although we pretend loue neuer ſo much. The time will not ſuffer to handle the reſt, which remaineth in this Text. Let vs rememeber that which hath beene ſaid, and giue all diligence to purſue theſe excellent vertues, that ſo wee may approoue our ſelues to be right Chriſtians, and look for the bleſſed hope promiſed in Ieſu Chriſt.</p>

This is verie fitlie and neceſſarily added, for as there bee manie, which regarding men onely, how to pleaſe, and not to grieue or offend them, altogether forgetting their dutie towardes the Lord God, and wholie ſhutting him out, as though their chiefe care ſhould be of men, let paſſe godlineſſe: ſo there bee ſome that offende on the other ſide, which looking alwaies ſo high, as to haue reſpect to the Lord and his trueth, to bee earneſt and fierie in that, ouerlooke men, forgetting the duties which they owe vnto them: the holie Apoſtle meeteth with this miſchiefe, and telleth vs that we muſt ſo loue God, that we alſo loue men: ioyne, ſaith he, to your godlines brotherly kindneſſe: For vnleſſe this bee ioyned, and goe with our zeale of Gods worde, it is no true godlines, although we bee neuer ſo ſound in iudgement, and ſeem to be as hot as Moſes or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, yea euen to bee ſwallowed vp with burning zeale: for it doth not proceed from Gods ſpirit, who doth alſo work the loue towards men wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he goeth: but it doeth proceed of ſome corrupt cauſe, as of vaine glorie, or ſelfe-loue, and ſuch like, and deſerueth not indeed to bee called godlie deuotion, no more than the true faith can bee without vertue, or deſerueth to bee called ought, ſaue a ſhadowe or image of faith, if it bee without good workes: but it is a bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21168:76"/>which reſembleth the true zeale, which doth euermore carrie with it, a loue and care towards men. True it is that to be zealous in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is a ſingular and ſpeciall gift of God, &amp; they which be without it are but brutiſh, and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creatures, not knowing God, nor how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious his glorie is: yet this muſt bee looked vnto in euerie one of vs whether we beare a louing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection toward our brethren or no: for if we loue God, we muſt needs loue men, which beare his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. If we delight in the word of God, this is one chief point of doctrin that is taught in it, that we be louing &amp; kind vnto men. Therfore as S. Paul 1. Cor. 13. ſheweth, that verie excellent gifts doe not profit without loue, ſo likewiſe in this place we be taught, that if wee would ſeeme to bee godlie, and haue not loue, it is nothing woorth. Let euery man therefore lay this doctrine to his heart that he muſt be earneſt in the cauſes of the Lord, zealous in religion, preferring God and his truth, before all men, whoſoeuer, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be: but yet withall, that hee muſt look downe vnto men, rendring vnto them their due alſo, this doing hee may bee bolde he is in the right way. Vnto this brotherlie loue we be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ioyne loue. It may bee heere demaunded againe what maner of ſpeech this is, which the Apoſtle doth vſe, for is not brotherlie kindnes or brotherly loue, as the word doth ſignifie, and loue all one? Wee muſt bee farre from thinking Saint Peter to deale with ſo little heede, as to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21168:76"/>will vs to ioine the very ſame thing to the ſame: we muſt therefore ſeeke a difference betweene theſe two. Wee may take this difference, either that the firſt of theſe doth expreſſe what we owe towardes the godly, who bee chieflie called the brethren, and the latter what wee owe vnto all, both good and bad: or els the former doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the inward affection of loue, and the latter the outwarde practiſe of the ſame: for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in both theſe, is needfull to bee opened. If wee take then the former ſenſe, we bee willed to ioyne with our loue towards the godlie and faithfull brethren (whom we ought chieflie, and more deerely to fauour) a loue alſo which may reach euen ouer al, good and bad, friend and ſoe. This Saint Paule teacheth when hee willeth vs to doe good to all men, but eſpeciallie to them which are of the houſhold of faith. So that wee muſt acknowledge our ſelues bound, in ſome ſort, euen to the wicked, according as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour doth teach, Matth. 5. Bleſſe them which curſe you, pray for them which hate &amp; perſecute: and ſaint Paule ſaith, Rom. 12. If thine enemie hunger, feed him: if hee thirſt, giue him drinke. Well then, although this bee verie hard to mans nature, yet the Lord doth ſtraightly require it at our handes: and ſo that if this bee wanting, wee doe but deceiue our ſelues. If wee take it in the latter ſenſe, the firſt word to ſignifie the inward affection of loue, the other, the outwarde pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: then we haue heere a notable point to be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21168:77"/>obſerued, not to ouerſhoote our ſelues in our loue, in iudging it to be right, and ſincere, when it is halting and lame: for many when they heare that we are ſo ſtraightlie charged for to loue our neighbours, and that without the ſame, there is nothing good in vs, or which God accepteth; looke no further but thus, whether they beare any grudge or euill will in their mindes, and if they can ſay, I hurt no man, nor I mean no hurt to any, they perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that this is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent loue. And ſo a ſtone meaning no hurt may be ſayd to loue: other ſomewhat wiſer, do not onelie looke to that one thing, whether they beare euill will, but alſo whether they haue any kind of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in them, &amp; heer they ſtay when they ſhuld go yet this ſtep further, to ſee that this kindnes in them, breaketh foorth into good and charitable deeds: for there may be ſome louing affection in a man, and yet bring forth but ſlender fruites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a great ſloth in nature, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth men from putting their loue in vre, for loue is labourſome and painfull, as Saint Paule ſetteth it foorth 1. Theſſ. 1. when he ſaith, <hi>Your labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring loue.</hi> If then we will loue the brethren, heere is the touchſtone, by which we may prooue our loue, that we ſpare not for any labour or coſt, nor yet waxe wearie, becauſe loue is not like one that is laizie and luskiſh, loitering at home within a mans breaſt, but ſteppeth abroad, and is very diligent: neither doth it preferre euerie light commoditie and vaine pleaſure, before
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21168:77"/>the benefite of the brethren. Then by this it is manifeſt, how that all thoſe which would ſeem to bee godlie, and yet haue caſt away the care ouer their brethren, at the leaſt thus farre, that they will neither trauell, nor bee at anie charge, for other mens ſake, whoſe wealth they ſhould procure, eſpeciallie of the ſoule, for therein ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the chiefe triall of loue: becauſe it is a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous thing, to be very tender ouer the bodie, a rotten carcaſſe, and to pitie the miſerie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo much, and in the meane while, not to care for that, that is more precious, namely the ſoule, the releeuing and healing of which, ſhall be the happineſſe of the whole man for euer. This I ſpeake becauſe we ſee manie, that will beſtowe ſomewhat vpon the releefe of the bodilie miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which haue no pitie vpon men, which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in blindneſſe and ignorance, whoſe ſoules are famiſhed and pined, for want of food, full of deadly woundes and ſores, which are not ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, bound in the bandes and chaines of ſinne, holden vnder captiuitie by Satan, euen readie to bee ſwallowed vp of the bottomleſſe gulfe of hell: the cauſe indeede is, that they haue not yet learned to pitie their owne ſoules, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot pitie the ſoules of their brethren: for for if they did knowe the ſpirituall miſerie, they would neither ſpare night nor day in trauelling to haue it eaſed: whereas now contrariwiſe they can pull back men from godlineſſe, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them from ſeeking after ſaluation: they can
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21168:78"/>laugh and ſport themſelues in their owne ſinnes, and in the ſinnes of their neighbours, as though there were no miſerie therein, finallie, being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell murtherers of ſoules, woulde neuertheleſſe gladlie be deemed charitable. But their bountiful almes doth want ſeaſoning. Let vs learne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to pitie, and ſhewe kindneſſe to the bodilie neceſſitie of men, and not to forget eſpeciallie and aboue all, to procure with all diligence, as much as lyeth in vs, the ſaluation of their ſoules: otherwiſe we can neuer be ſaid to ioyne loue, and godlineſſe togither.</p>
               <p>In that which followeth in the foure next ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there is ſhewed partlie the great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular commodities, which we ſhall reape, if we be garniſhed with theſe foreſaide vertues: and partlie the diſcommodities, which wee ſhall find, in the want of the ſame. And this Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſetteth foorth, not ſtaying in the bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the vertues, which indeed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, being ſo precious and excellent, ſhoulde mooue vs, but dealeth with vs, as with thoſe which bee lumpiſh and dull, needing many ſpurres to be pricked forward withall, and all little enough: let vs be carefull therefore to take heed to that hee ſaith, <hi>If theſe thinges bee with you, and abound, they will make, &amp;c.</hi> In this eight verſe, hee beginneth to ſhew the commodities, which ſhall redound vnto vs, if we ſo giue our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that wee may bee richlie decked with theſe graces: <hi>They will make you,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21168:78"/>
                  <hi>that yee ſhall not bee idle nor vnfruitfull in the acknowledging of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> It is a ſhamefull thing, when God hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto vs in his ſonne, hath called vs into his ſeruice out of miſerable bondage, for vs to bee idle and vnfruitfull: If the Lord haue planted vs, if he haue dreſſed vs, then, as it is alſo ſaid by our Sauiour Chriſt, Iohn. 15. Heerein is my Father glorified, that yee goe and bring foorth much fruit. Then it is by this place very apparant, that a man may draw out a ſure &amp; infallible argument againſt all thoſe which are idle, and ſlouthfull in the profeſſion of religion, and, as they ſay, key cold, or ſlacke in the ſeruice of God, or vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good workes; namelie, that they are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, voyd of faith and thoſe vertues which doe euer accompanie the ſame; for when Saint Peter ſaith, <hi>If theſe thinges be with you, they will make that yee ſhall not bee idle nor vnfruitfull,</hi> it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth neceſſarilie, that ſuch as bee idle, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth for want of zeale, or be vnfruitful, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſinnes, it is becauſe they did neuer yet come to the true knowledge of Chriſt; they may well boaſt themſelues of their ſtrong faith, make a braue ſhewe of their skill and fine wit, ſo that men might thinke there were ſome deepe thing in them, and that they ſhould be able euen to iudge, and giue a right verdict in all matters; but a man reading but euen this place, finding them idle and vnfruitful, (yea euen a ſimple man) ſhal eaſilie ſound them to the bottome, and ſay of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21168:79"/>them, that they haue not as yet knowne or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſt: becauſe they want thoſe former thinges. We muſt note this alſo, when hee ſaith, If theſe thinges abound in you: this is, that wee ſhould not content our ſelues with a ſcant and bare meaſure of faith, of vertue, of knowledge, and of the reſt, as hee ſetteth them downe: but we muſt labour to haue a daylie increaſe, for that muſt be gathered by this, that hee pricketh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward theſe ripe and grounded men. A doctrine moſt neceſſarie to be vrged, becauſe if men haue gone two or three ſteppes, or haue once a little begunne to labour about theſe thinges, ſo that they can looke backe, and ſee ſome come behind them, or can ſay, I thank God, I know ſomwhat; I hope that I am not without faith, ſomewhat there is which I haue done, that I would be loth to doe againe: they by and by perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they are ſufficientlie furniſhed: ſo that they will not ſtick to ſay. I truſt I haue that which ſhall ſerue the turne. Nay, the Apoſtle telleth vs another thing heere from the Lord, and that is, that we muſt ouerflowe in theſe, and abound: and truth it is, that theſe men which thinke they be well fraught, and ſo ſeeke for no further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſtore, haue as yet nothing, for if they had once found the ſweet of theſe things, &amp; ſeen withall that they are farre behinde, and in beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerlie need, they wold neuer content themſelues with ſo little: for who is hee, which feeleth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in worldlie treaſure, that will crie hoe, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21168:79"/>ſay, I haue ynough? Is there leſſe in the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie treaſures to drawe men to like them, than in the earthlie? Or is it becauſe men doe not know them? Wee muſt learne to take heede of ſuch therefore, as would beare men in hand that it is ſufficient, yea, that it is beſt of all, for men to content themſelues with ſome ciuill honeſtie, and not to ſeeke, and wearie their mindes to gain knowledge. But theſe were neuer as yet the men, which might be rightly called the ſchollers of Chriſt, much leſſe we are to deeme them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie maſters or teachers of others, when they go flat contrarie to the holie Apoſtle of Chriſt, who willeth to ſeeke for ſo great aboundance: when as they would content themſelues, and perſwade others to bee contented, with ſcant a ſhadowe of theſe thinges, which ſhould bee ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie founde in them: Notwithſtanding ſome are ſo blind, that hauing no ſhadowe or ſhewe at all of goodneſſe, yet thinke they bee gone farre ynough. In the next verſe where hee ſaith, Hee that hath not theſe thinges is blinde, and ſeeth not a farre off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſinnes: Hee ſetteth foorth the diſcommodities which followe the want of theſe vertues. And this hee doeth, becauſe ſome man will bee little mooued to heare that commoditie which hee ſpake of, and will ſay, what care I though I bee idle? What care I though I bee vnfrutfull? I will not goe about to be better then other men,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21168:80"/>what ſhould I labour to excell thoſe which are wiſer than I? If then they will not regarde this, that theſe vertues will make them excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of God, yet let them conſider what the Apoſtle maketh them without the ſame, where he affirmeth them firſt to bee blind, (a verie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable thing in the bodlie ſight, much more in the ſpirituall, which he heere meaneth,) when God hath ſo clearelie reuealed himſelf in the face of his ſonne, in the knowledge which bringeth ſaluation, that the God of this worlde, as Saint Paule ſpeaketh, 2. Corinth. 4. ſhould ſo blinde their mindes, that the light of the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt which is the image of God, ſhuld not ſhine vnto them. Secondlie, he ſaith, they cannot ſee a farre off, or that they be poreblinde, for ſuch as haue the beames of ſightſcattering, or ſpreading aſunder, ſo ſoone as they be out of the eie, can ſee well ynough iuſt by them, but not farre off, to theſe Saint Peter doth compare thoſe men. But it may be asked what he meaneth; firſt to ſay they be ſtarke blinde, and afterward to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſome ſight vnto them. It may ſeeme by this word, that he maketh their caſe not ſo euill, as before hee had ſaide it was; yes euen as euill, for hee ſaith as much in this word as hee did in the other; for when hee ſaith, They cannot ſee a farre off, hee taketh from them all ſight of heauenlie thinges, which are remooued from vs, and ſeene onlie by faith; hee doeth not denie them the ſight of thoſe things which are at hand,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21168:80"/>becauſe they haue a good and a ſharpe ſight in the things of this world, for the moſt part, better then they which can ſee a farre off. But what are theſe quicke wits the better, when they are but for this world; and their condition no better then that of the poore beaſt, (yea much worſe) when we reſpect the miſerie in the world to come? Let not this therefore cauſe them to ſet vp their bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that they can ſee ſo well and pearcinglie at hand, (that is, in earthly things) when as they are as blinde as beetles in things a farre off, that is to ſay, in heauenly things. Here wee muſt ſeeke to haue eyes giuen vs of God, with which wee may be able to ſee beyond this world: for before ſuch time as the Lorde hath giuen vs ſome glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of heauenly things, wee ſhall neuer couet to obtaine them. And this is the cauſe that theſe poore blinde men neuer paſſe greatly to knowe the Goſpell of Chriſt. Thirdly he ſaith, they haue forgotten that they were purged from their olde ſinnes: as hee ſaid they were blinde, ſo now hee ſaith, they are forgetfull: and this forgetfulneſſe is ſo much the more ſhamefull, as it is in a chiefe and principall point of true religion. But where ſhall we finde the man, which if he be examined will confeſſe that hee hath forgotten this poynt? It ſeemeth none doe forget it, becauſe the verie wicked will ſeeme to ſet all vpon this ſcore, that their ſinnes are purged, and that maketh them ſinne ſo frankly. But if wee vnderſtand the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle well, wee ſhall finde very many which haue
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21168:81"/>forgotten this point. Now here wee muſt firſt note that our ſinnes are ſayd to be purged, when there is ſatisfaction made for them by redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they are ſayd to bee purged by grace of ſanctification, when by the power of Gods ſpirit, ſinne, or all ſinfull affections are ſuppreſſed and killed in vs: ſo then there is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in redemption, and there is alſo a purging by ſanctification. Now if they haue not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſo much, but that they can prattle of the purging their ſinnes, by redemption; yet they haue forgotten this, that they were redeemed to the ende they ſhould no longer ſerue ſinne, but purge away the olde leauen: but being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe former graces, hee ſayth they haue forgotten this, not meaning thereby that they had euer learned it, for if they had, yet at the leaſt they had not well learned it: wee may ſee by this how many there bee, which are ſtarke blind, and haue forgotten that Chriſtians are called to liue in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of life. If we look vpon the ſmall number of thoſe which haue a care to ſeeke after the Lord, and how ſmall a part of them doe come (I will not ſay to abound) but to haue a compotent meaſure of thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named vertues: let vs come alwaies to this true meaſure, &amp; not be deceiued neither in our ſelues, nor in other. Let vs be aſhamed if we be carnall, to take vpon vs the name of the true profeſſors: let vs denie vnto them the honourable name of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21168:81"/>Chriſtians, which are but filthie ſwine, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane dogges, as our Sauiour Chriſt calleth them: to conclude this matter, none are allowed to be true receiuers of the Goſpell, but ſuch as ioyne vertue with their faith, and with vertue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſo temperance, patience, godlines, brotherlie kindneſſe, and loue, and ſuch as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doe ſeeke to abound in them: the reſt which care not for theſe, or content themſelues with the bare ſhewe of them, although they would ſeeme to bee worſhippers of GOD, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout perſons, yet they are by this doctrine of the Lord wholie ſhut foorth, vntill they haue learned a new leſſon. Remember that this is the doctrine of God, and not of man. Remember that wee muſt ſtand and dwell vpon it, not for a day, or two, while wee haue heard it, but all our life long to bring it to the practiſe: it is plaine and cleere, none can bee excuſed if they knowe it not, and ſo through ſimplicitie ſtand vpon the common faith, thinking to ſhroude themſelues well vnder the ſhadow of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: but when GOD hath warned them, who will pitie them, when they will not be warned? if this were not tolde vs, and that by God himſelfe, wee might thinke, as men doe commonly, that a very little doth content the Lord, that no great things are required at the hands of Chriſtians, and other ſuch fooliſh and vaine opinions, as to ſay, they muſt hope well whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God telleth them, there is no hope, vnleſſe they walke this way, alſo that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21168:82"/>it is not good to be ouer preciſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes a man cannot proceede too farre, nor offer too much obedience to the Lord. To make an end, let none of all theſe things blinde vs, becauſe they blinde ſome, which ſtand in reputation of their owne wiſedome.</p>

               <p>IT hath been tolde vnto you alreadie, vpon the verſes which goe next before, how that Saint Peter regarding how dull wee are and backward in godlineſſe, contented not himſelfe with his exhortation which he maketh, but ſetteth downe what we ſhall gaine if wee follow his aduiſe, and alſo what hurt we ſhall ſuſtaine by the contrarie: and this hath partly been handled in the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verſes, and partly in theſe two which wee haue now in hand: where indeede he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſo great a commoditie which wee ſhall gaine, if wee giue all diligence to purſue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things, as is almoſt incomparable: euen this,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21168:82"/>that we ſhall come to the aſſurance, that wee are called and choſen of God: a thing ſo neceſſarie for vs to knowe, that without it, there is no right faith, no franke and willing obedience, no ſound ioy. For although without this, men ſeeme to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, yet it is but a wauering fantaſie, to doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things, yet they proceede but from a ſeruile minde, to laugh and reioyce, yet is it but in a deſperate madneſſe, which in very deede is greatly to be wondered at, how men ſhould bee able to ſport themſelues, and yet to ſpeake in their conſciences after this manner, there is Hell, and eternall flames of vengeance prepared for ſinners, and I am not ſure whether I ſhall eſcape or not: this deſperate and brutiſh ſecuritie ſhall be apparant to be the more mad, if wee compare it, &amp; ſet it forth by an outward compariſon. Let it be thus, a man is taken in a robberie or murther, impriſoned, brought before the Iudge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, by ſute of friends repriued vntill ſuch time as they may ſue for to get him a pardon: in the meane time ſome of his acquaintance come to this murtherer, and will him to bee of good cheere, and merie: he will anſwere, vnleſſe he be ſome mad and deſperate ruffian, I am condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the gallowes, the Iudge hath pronounced the ſentence of death vpon me, I know not how hard a thing it will be to obtaine a pardon, I ſtand in great doubt, and for this cauſe I cannot bee merie, vnleſſe I might know for certaintie that I ſhould eſcape if I did once knowe that, I could
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21168:83"/>bee as merie as any man that liueth, before that time I may ſeeme to laugh, but my heart is full of feare and ſorrowe. And is it not thus with vs all, are wee not all of vs guiltie, and alreadie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the ſentence of the higheſt Iudge, not to ſome torment of one day, or ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but to the fire that ſhall neuer be quenched? When men can bee merie therefore and laugh euen in thoſe things which cauſe this deſtruction, and yet doe feele that they are not ſure to eſcape this dreadfull vengeance, is it not a mad mirth and a deſperate laughter, in which if they were not become very ſenſleſſe blockes, they ſhould feele many gripings at the heart, which would marre all their mirth, yea a worme that gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ſuch wiſe, that they can haue no quiet reſt, nor as I ſaîde before, no ſound ioy. If wee were not therefore more then deſperate and madde fooles, the thought of hell would dampe all our mirth vntill ſuch time as we be ſure that we haue eſcaped it. This then which the Apoſtle ſayth here is a princely commoditie, that walking the way which hee hath preſcribed, wee ſhall come to the aſſurance, that wee are the called and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of the Lord. But it may bee demaunded how this can agree with other ſayings in the holie Scriptures, which doe plainly teach that GOD chooſeth whom he will of his owne free grace: for which Saint Paul alleageth out of Moſes, that God will haue mercie on whomſoeuer hee will haue mercie, and whom he will hee hardeneth:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21168:83"/>adding thereupon, that it is neither of him that willeth, nor yet of him that runneth, but of God which ſheweth mercie. Againe, the doctrine of Poperie is, that God doth make choiſe, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſpecting the good deedes which he did foreſee in them: and ſo the election ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the worthines of the men: we are to anſwere, that this place hath nothing in it which is contrarie to that free choiſe which God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth without reſpect of any thing that is in vs: for hee could finde nothing in vs that might any way moue him, neither doth it ſerue at all for to proue that election is condition all: becauſe Saint Peter doth not handle in this place, whereupon electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is founded, or what moued God to make choiſe, nor to ſhew wherein the certaintie and ſtableneſſe of election doth ſtand: but his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, to teach vs how wee ſhall attaine to this incomparable treaſure, to bee out of doubt, and ſurely reſolued in our ſelues, not by fantaſied o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, but by ſure and ſubſtantiall proofe, that we bee choſen of God, and therefore cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. If wee reſpect the vnchangeable counſell of GOD, therein doth reſt alone the ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of election, becauſe GOD which cannot bee deceiued, nor cannot repent, or chaunge, hath made the choiſe, therefore thoſe whom hee hath choſen, can neuer periſh: but if we regard the way and meanes, by which we may come to know this fauour of God to bee toward vs, the Lord by his Apoſtle telleth vs, that this is the way,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21168:84"/>euen to giue all diligence, and ſtudie to bee richly decked with his graces, or thoſe forenamed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: for by theſe wee ſhall vndoubtedly knowe, becauſe if wee haue them, if they abound in vs, if we walke in them, we ſhall, as he ſaith, neuer fall. Let vs learne therefore firſt this, that election in it ſelfe reſteth vpon the vnchangeable purpoſe and counſell of God. Then ſecondly, that wee are not to ſetch the certaintie of it in our ſelues, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome reuelation, neither are wee to clime vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to ſearch in the counſels of GOD, whether our names bee in the booke of life. But we are to fetch our warrant from within our ſelues, and that from the fruites of the ſpirit, which indeede although it bee out of our ſelues, yet becauſe it is not of our ſelues, is certaine and infallible. If ye will vnderſtand this more plainly, firſt I ſay, it is out of our ſelues, or from within our ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we muſt take the trial, whether thoſe things be in vs, which are giuen to all thoſe whom God doth chuſe, then I ſay it is not of our ſelues: for if it were, it ſhould bee altogether vncertaine. But of the ſeale of God wherewith hee hath ſealed vs, which is the ſpirit of ſanctification: now marke well I pray you, If you doe (ſaith S. Peter) theſe things, you ſhall neuer fall: and why, is it becauſe our doings are ſo perfect &amp; ſure, or that we are ſo conſtant of our ſelues? no not ſo, but by theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues we know that wee are ſealed with Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whoſe worke we feele in vs: we know alſo that as many as are led by the ſpirit of GOD are the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21168:84"/>ſonnes of GOD. Rom. 8. From hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that looke how much more a man feeleth in himſelfe the increaſe of knowledge, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of vertues and heauenly deſires, ſo much more ſure he is, that he is the child of God; and as the one increaſeth, ſo increaſeth alſo the other. Contrariwiſe, when a man feeleth within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an euill conſcience, feeleth that he is darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his vnderſtanding, ledde by the luſtes of ſinne: hee ſhall in ſpite of his teeth within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſing this dolefull ſong, I know not whether I ſhall be ſaued or not: and looke how the other may ſay, I knowe I ſhall be ſaued, becauſe God hath ſealed me with his ſpirit; ſo may this ſay, I am ſure to bee damned continuing in this caſe, becauſe I haue not faith, but only a wauering &amp; doubtfull opinion. We may ſee by this how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall they are, and mercifull to their owne ſoules, which with all their power day and night giue vp themſelues to ſeeke after the knowledge and obedience of the Lordes will: for not giuing ouer, nor waxing wearie, they ſhall in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time, if they ply it hard, finde ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Lorde, in the increaſe of faith and vertue, that will cauſe them to ſay, wee haue not loſt our labor. On the other ſide we may ſee how vnkind and cruell they are to themſelues, which through idlenes and ſloth, in ſeeking after God, with their daily and continuall ſinnes, doe euen as it were cut the throat of their faith, ſeeing they can not haue truſt in him, whome they doe ſo
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21168:85"/>much diſobey. This place is as a mightie engine to ouerthrowe the vanitie of ſundrie opinions which doe reigne in men. As firſt of all in thoſe which crie out againſt this doctrine, as a thing which will make men careleſſe and idle in the ſeruice of God, and ſtoppe the courſe of good works, I beſeech you marke how wel theſe great wiſe men haue profited in Gods ſchoole, ſee how they agree with the holy Apoſtle: he ſaith we are to giue all our ſtudie &amp; diligence in good works to come to the ſure and vndoubted knowledge, that wee be choſen vnto life: they ſay quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, if ye will haue men carefull of well doing, away with the doctrine of election, for it will marre all: thus the wiſdome of fleſh doth proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lift vp it ſelfe euen againſt God (but how foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, a verie childe may ſee:) Doeth that thing which wee can not come to the knowledge of, without exceeding care of godlines, abundance of vertue, and plentie of all good workes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in men the ſtudy and care of good workes? But proude fleſh is worthily blind. Some other, although not thus brutiſhly blinded, yet greatly ouerſeene, when they thinke on this doctrine, which is ſet vp vnto vs as the mark for vs to aime at in all our doings: and the triall whether wee haue done well or not: I meane the triall in this reſpect, and when a man hath done many good deeds, he ſhall know he hath not done them wel, if he yet doubt, whether he be one of Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, for howſoeuer he paſſeth it ouer, yet his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21168:85"/>which doeth in ſome ſort know, that hee hath not dealt but for vaineglorie, or ſome other ſiniſter reſpect, will not ſuffer him to haue this faith: For God doth not worke ſo darkely by his ſpirit in men, but that they may learne to knowe whether it be of him, if they would make a due triall: becauſe wee muſt not reſt in the outward doing of good things, but in the right doing. Let him therefore which giueth himſelfe to doe good workes, (and yet feeleth not this, which S. Peter ſaith, wee ſhall) ſuſpect that his doings are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen, and be carefull to faſhion them after the rules of the word. A third ſort of men there be, which with might and maine will defend this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that men ought to be ſure of ſaluation, that we can not more honour God, then to giue full credit to his promiſes, and becauſe the plaine teſtimony of the ſcripture compelleth them, they affirme it conſtantly, and condemne the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as a ſoule errour, that God hath choſen men, and men come to feele and to know this: And therefore becauſe it is a true doctrine, they ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they themſelues are ſure, that God hath choſen them, but when they take not the way to become ſure, which S. Peter hath here ſet downe, but goe in a contrarie path, and are ſpotted with filthy crimes, wee may boldly ſay, they be lyars: for although they brag with their tongues of that that they ſhould be, yet there is a birde in their breſt, which doth ſing in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary note, &amp; telleth
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21168:86"/>them plainly what they be. Another kind of men there be, which in no caſe can be perſwaded, that any man can be ſure of ſaluation, and therefore with ſcoffes they aske of them which profeſſe the word, when God told them ſo? If it were a thing which were not to be, or could not be knowen, then the Apoſtle hath greatly ouerſhot himſelfe, in telling vs how wee ſhall come to be ſure. But aske a queſtion of them, whether they doe not beleeue in God, euery one will anſwere, I put all my whole truſt in him: reaſon then a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and tell them, that the Scripture which can not lie, ſaith, That all which truſt in God ſhall be ſaued: how then will they ioyne theſe togither, that they truſt in God, and yet doubt whether they ſhall be ſaued? can God deceiue? or ſay they, they know not what? Vndoubtedly if they did know that they haue truſt, they ſhould alſo know they can not periſh. But let vs learne by this the miſerie of our time: in which men do ſtill thinke this doctrine to be ſtrange. Now let vs come to the particular application of this doctrine, in which euery one muſt come home to himſelfe, remembring firſt, that ſuch as God hath called home to himſelfe, and choſen to be his children, he doth alſo giue vnto them true faith and feeling that they bee his elect: and ſuch as perceiue no ſuch thing in themſelues, are in a verie miſerable caſe, and as yet wee may ſay forlorne creatures: therefore euery man in himſelfe muſt aske this queſtion of his owne ſoule, How goeth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21168:86"/>with thee? Art thou ſure God hath choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee? Doeſt thou feele any aſſurance of eternal life? The conſcience will anſwere vprightly if wee be not negligent to make inquirie: then if we find this within. I am not ſure, for I doubt and ſtagger: we muſt inquire with our ſelues thus, what is the cauſe, God is faithfull which hath promiſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life vnto all which beleeue: our heart will make anſwere, Thou regardeſt not the feare of God, thou art full of foule ſinnes, euill luſtes doe reigne in thee, thou doeſt not ſtudy for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods worde, thou art vnfruitfull and barren in good workes, therefore thou canſt not ſay, I am led by the ſpirit of God, and therefore ſure I ſhall be ſaued. If he be wiſe he will not ſtay here, as the manner of fooles is, ſaying I am not ſure indeed, neither do I thinke any man can be, I commit it to God, let him doe with me what he will: theſe ſpeeches may ſeeme to haue ſome wit &amp; godlines in them, but they are indeed deuiliſh and madde, becauſe God hath taught vs a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary leſſon in this place: but go this ſteppe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may I come to this aſſurance? and which is the way? The Lord doth anſwere by his Apoſtle, Thou maieſt come to this aſſurance, and pointeth him out the way: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which you haue heard, wherein he muſt painefully trauell and goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, not for a gird or a braid, and waxe idle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but ſtill labour, for theſe men had gone a great way, and yet they are willed to proceede ſtill: if the Lorde guie not this aſſurance, we are
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21168:87"/>to labour ſo much the more, and to be ſo much the more importunate to ſuſpect our iudgement, and to ſeeke for knowledge, to call our ſelues to a more ſtrait account, to ſet a watch ouer our affections to ſee with what mind we doe things, to foſter no ſinne willingly in vs, nor to be ſlacke to any good worke which God hath appointed, to call &amp; crie vnto God for faith, and his ſpirit to guide vs, to vſe the means diligently which God hath appointed, as the hearing, ſearching, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating in the word: thus in time (for it is wroght in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by degrees, &amp; they neuer come to the full) God wil let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee that he is their God. That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life nor death, height or depth, things preſent or things to come, Angels, principalities, nor powers, nor any creature ſhall ſeparate vs from his loue in Chriſt. It followeth in the next verſe, For by this meanes an entring ſhall be miniſtred vnto you abundantly into the euerlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is a confirmation of the laſt clauſe of the former ſentence, where he ſaith, If you doe theſe things, you ſhall neuer fall: and why, becauſe you ſhall haue a great entrance into the eternall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt: as that is a confirmation of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where he ſaith, Make your calling &amp; election ſure, as the reaſon followeth there, Ye ſhall come to be ſure: how? becauſe he which proceedeth ſo far that he knoweth he ſhall neuer fall away from God to deſtruction, he is (as it muſt needs be) ſure alſo that he is choſen, for hee ſpeaketh not here of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21168:87"/>euery particular fall into ſin (which is of the moſt godly:) but ſaith S. Peter, I tell you if you do theſe things, ye ſhall neuer fall: not becauſe there is any ſuch ſtablenes in our ſelues, or in our own works, but we know that they be the fruits of Gods ſpirit in vs, which is his ſeale, ſet vpon none but thoſe whome he doth marke vp to life eternall, &amp; he is vnchangeable: ſo it followeth here, Ye ſhall not fall, for they that haue a rich entrance into the kingdome of Chriſt, which is euerlaſting, ſo that Chriſt doth raigne in them, as hee doth in all the faithfull by his ſpirit, can not fall, vntill the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt faile, and his kingdome come to an end. For we muſt note, that the force of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſteth in the difference which is between the kingdome of Chriſt and the kingdomes of this world: in which though they be neuer ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and full of pollicie and wiſedome, yet they ſhould come to an end: and therefore a man can not rightly ſay vnto the ſubiectes, you haue a mightie prince, who is bountifull and gracious, your peace therefore and happie eſtate ſhall endure for euer: nay, the mightie may bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if not by men, at leaſt wiſe by death, and ſo they may bee to day in peace and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, to morrow all in an vprore, to day vnder a louing and gracious prince, to morrow vnder a fierce tyrant: ſo vncertaine is the ſtate of the kingdome of this worlde: but in the kingdome of Chriſt, whoſe power is aboue all, and can neuer come to an end, but is as hee ſaith here,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21168:88"/>eternall, it is farre otherwiſe, becauſe his ſtate is vnchangeable, ſo is theirs that bee once entred thereinto, and therefore they are ſure they can neuer fall. Whoſoeuer doeth but euen ſtraightly looke ouer theſe words of the Apoſtle, if he haue any ſight at all, hee muſt needes confeſſe all this, the matter is ſo cleere, that wee can but maruell how it ſhould come to paſſe that this doctrine of the Lord, ſet forth by his Apoſtle, ſhould find ſo fewe friends, and ſo many extreme enemies: but in deede men which are lyars, doe in this thing confeſſe the trueth, that they feele not any ſuch matter, and therefore can not abide to heare that all true godly men, and faithfull Chriſtians haue this knowledge in themſelues: but let vs giue eare to the Apoſtle, who telleth vs how we ſhal come to haue Chriſt to be our king, and to raigne ouer vs, namely, if wee yeelde vp our ſelues to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance of his ſpirit, which worketh all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in our heartes, ſubduing and vanquiſhing all the rebels which we be are about in vs. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it muſt needes bee granted, that ſuch as are beaſtly Epicures, following their owne fleſhly minde, letting looſe the raines, and giuing the ſwinge vnto the raging luſtes of the fleſh, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the knowledge of Gods will, and therefore regard not his worde, though with full mouth they call Chriſt their king and their Lorde; yet when God ſaith here by his Apoſtle, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into his kingdome is by this meanes, that men follow after vertue, knowledge, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21168:88"/>they ſhewe that they bee none of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, beeing altogither void of his ſpirit, but the bondſlaues of ſinne and Sathan, whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome they vpholde, with tooth and naile: and that maketh them, euen as thoſe which are of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other corporation to fight againſt the truth, and thoſe which profeſſe it: deuiſing all the colours and ſhiftes they can to maintaine ſinne, inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the ſlanders that may be to diſcredit the godly conuerſation of ſuch as follow the way here preſcribed: condemning them as ouer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and curious, if they doe but looke this way which God willeth all his ſeruants to walke: if God do open their eies, to ſee but euen in a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, that which he doth teach in this place, they would be aſhamed of their maſter &amp; bluſh at that, which now they boaſt and bragge of: they would alſo confeſſe that like blind buzzards and madde beaſts, they haue fought againſt God, and not men: finally it would make them change their waies, and ſeeke diligently to haue the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes within themſelues, that they be the ſeruants of God. Wee muſt marke well one other thing which is here ſpoken, to wit, that he ſaith, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhall be miniſtred vnto you, abundantly or richly: as if hee ſhould ſay, When yee haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured and trauelled, to be as it were, well ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſeaſoned in godlineſſe, and plentifullie decked with all graces and giftes of the ſpirit, yee ſhall by degrees proceed ſo far, &amp; gaine ſo much, that your entrance into the kingdome of Chriſt,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21168:89"/>ſhall be very great: wherupon it doth follow, that they ſhalbe paſt danger, &amp; may wel warrant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of ſure ſtanding, in as much as Chriſt hath not only begun to raigne in them, and to be their king, but alſo in great meaſure and mightily. But doth he not adde this one worde more then nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth? Is it not enough to haue an entrance, vnles we haue a rich entrance into his kingdome? doth Chriſt once begin to raigne in a man, &amp; to driue out the power of Sathan, and afterward caſt him off again to deſtruction? I anſwer, that this word is not added in vaine, for wee are taught thereby to take heed that we content not our ſelues with ſome little taſte and ſmall entrance: for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to make a difference between ſuch on the one part as make ſome beginning, &amp; haue ſome good deſires and motions in them, and doe taſte of the good worde of God, and are in ſome ſort lightned, but ouercome with ſinnefull luſts and vaine delights of the fleſh, they ſlide back againe ſuddenly, they were but for a brunt, it bringeth forth no ripe fruit in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither to ſpeak properly did Chriſt euer raign in them: &amp; ſuch on the other part as proceed vnto the deepe rooting out of ſin, &amp; ſure and faſt planting the truth in their hearts, going forward daily from grace to grace, &amp; from ſtrength to ſtrength, vntill Chriſt haue ſet vp his throne in them, &amp; beare ſway, to the ouerthrow of the power of darknes, &amp; bereauing the deuill of the intereſt he had, and thruſting him from the poſſeſſion which he held: a doctrine which muſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21168:89"/>needs do vs much good if we beleeue it: &amp; very needful to be vrged inſtantly, conſidering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; diſpoſition of men at this day: they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of going too farre in vertue &amp; knowledge, they count it a needles thing to be admoniſhed or taught diligently, they take great ſcorne to be counted ſuch as may be amended, yea, and that which is more, when as they haue not learned the firſt point of a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſcholler, they will ſeem perfect: ſo far are they from hauing this abundant entring into the kingdome of Chriſt. Learne here therfore, dearely beloued, &amp; learne it well, lay ſure hold thereof that it do not ſlip from you, for God teacheth vs here the only way to life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: let go the vaine dreames and doltiſh opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people ſotted in their ignorance, which are ſo farre blinded by the malice of Sathan, that which way ſoeuer they goe, ſtill they are in hope of eternall glory, as though the way to heauen were ſo broad that a man could not go out of it, &amp; the entrance ſo eaſie, that he may enter whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will: for this is the diuinitie of our time; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer a man ſpend his time in ignorance, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for, nor ſeeking after the true knowledge of god, howſoeuer he be defiled with foule &amp; beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſins, that indeed there be nothing in him but pride, ſelfloue, vainglory, enuy, gluttony, the luſts of adultery, &amp; ſuch like, yea, ſo far, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doeth liken him to a ſwine or a dog: yet as if they ſay, he haue God in his mind, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, Lord haue mercy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, they think this is all that can
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21168:90"/>be required of men, they will not ſticke to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite all ſuch: beeing nothing at all acquainted with that, which God telleth in this place by his Apoſtle, how farre men muſt proceed in his feare before they can well warrant themſelues to be in good caſe. For yee may as well ioyne heauen and hell togither, fire and water will aſſoone agree, light and darkenes are as like one another, as the common faith is to that which we are taught in this place. But I will returne to apply this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the godly, for whome it is written: how they may, as we vſe to ſay, make this thing dead ſure: for there is many a godly man, which after long trauell, and much care to pleaſe God, is yet ſo matched with ſtubborn nature, ſo deeply infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and poiſoned with ſinne, that he is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, although hee haue gained much and doeth feele the power of Gods ſpirit in him, ſometimes to be in doubt, and to thinke his labour but loſt, becauſe he can not get ſo great a victorie as hee would faine: let not this man be diſmaied, but let him goe forward, remembring what is here promiſed: the more he wanteth the more let him ſtriue, and he ſhall plainly perceiue, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth his care &amp; trauell, conſidereth his ſighes and grones, and will performe all his deſires: let him remember that theſe men whome S. Peter wrote vnto, had obtained the precious faith, did know and were eſtabliſhed in the preſent trueth, and yet they were not ſo far but that they may be mooued to make their election ſure, to ſeeke a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21168:90"/>further entrance into the kingdome of Chriſt: &amp; ſo to continue that which was but begun. Wee ought the more to be mooued hereunto, becauſe the world is euer full of fearefull examples, which if they were wel conſidered, would make a mans haire to ſtand vpright, when he ſhall ſee that for want of this doctrine, or at the leaſt the not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing of it, there be many which ſeeme not only to haue had ſome good liking of the truth, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great zeale, euen to ſuffer ſomewhat for the ſame, which are become as cold as ice, &amp; ſcarſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point of godlines left in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yea though they would beare men in hand that they haue (like good ſchollers) proceeded to the higheſt fourme, yet when our great maſter ſhall poſe them, they ſhall not be allowed to ſit in the loweſt: ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a thing it is once to relent or ſlacken our care, vntill we haue gotten this full aſſurance, and made this rich entrance into the kingdome of Chriſt, that wee feele our ſelues to be led by the ſpirit of God, &amp; feele it, not by the vaine conceit of our owne fooliſh braine, nor by ſenſles ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but by the working and fruits of the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. If this were well weighed, men would not content themſelues with ſo little or nothing: they would not make ſo ſleight account of teaching; they would leaue off their ſlanderous &amp; reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full railings; they would not like filthy ſwine wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelues ſtill in the filthy mire of their ſins: they would not prattle ſo much of this, that al are ſinners, &amp; therefore thinke all are alike, ſhuffling
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21168:91"/>togither one with another: nay God will ſunder them, for hee hath taught here who be godly and faithfull, ſuch as hee taketh and accepteth for his children: and who be vngodly Infidels, children of the deuill and heires of hell. For in very deed, though all be ſinners, yet they greatly differ: for ſome continue in their ſinnes, ſeducing &amp; decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing themſelues with vaine hope of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: ſome do repent after the maner here preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them, which ſtandeth in this, that they clenſe themſelues more and more from all filthines of the fleſh, and grow in all vertues and graces, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they be decked in their ſoules with heauenly ornaments, and haue yeelded vp themſelues to haue Chriſt raigne in them. As for the common repentance, to cry onely with words for mercie, in ſome light meaſure to be greeued, to feare the iudgements of God, and yet the ſoule within no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing changed, nor the ſpirit renued, nor Chriſt raigning in the heart: it doth but deceiue al which truſt to it. Moſt true it is, that what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent, he is forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but this is as like to that repentance, which is here by S. Peter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as wee ſay, an apple is to an oiſter: for if we looke well vnto them both, we ſhall find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to agree but in very few things, &amp; thoſe euen the leaſt. Let vs I ſay, once againe faſten our ſteps in this way, let vs goe forward, and not ſo much as looke backe, vntill ſuch time as wee haue by our owne experience, prooued that to be true which is taught by S. Peter. For it is not enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21168:91"/>that this is true (although that be ſomwhat) vnles we trie it to be ſo by our ſelues. Hee is now a ſtarke foole which ſeeth this to be the only way to happines, and for ſloth will not walke in it: as though the kingdome of heauen were not worth the trauelling for. Wee may gather alſo in this place, if wee be not ſenſleſſe, how great enemies they be to the ſaluation of men, which would vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly debarre them of the word, that is appointed to be the inſtrument by which God worketh all theſe good things in his ſeruants: for without that (as it may be eaſily gathered here) we can do nothing. It doeth alſo appeare, that thoſe are in a miſerable caſe, whoſe office and duty is, not only to ſhew me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome part of Gods will, but to bring them thus far as S. Peter doth require, if they be not well furniſhed, &amp; haue walked firſt this way themſelues: for how ſhal they bring other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to that, which themſelues haue not nor know not? It doeth appeare alſo that God hath ſhewed a ſore iudgement againſt that people, which haue ſuch a guide as can not ſhew them this way: which is the onely way to heauen: for doubtles it is more then if he ſhould thunder vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them from heauen, or fire their houſes ouer their heads: eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are ſo blind, that they ſee not the plague, but thinke themſelues in better caſe then thoſe whom God ouer rules by his word. But wo be to thoſe blind guides which do not feed; &amp; wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is that people that want a ſhepheard. For how ſhal they euer hear of theſe things? We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but pity
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21168:92"/>their miſerie, and deſire the Lord to ſend redreſſe, in ſo lamentable and deſperate a caſe: which is thought to be nothing, becauſe in deed the moſt men knowe nothing: for had they but knowen what God requireth in that man whome he will ſaue, though they were not partakers of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet they would conſent and agree to the doctrine: and confeſſe that there is no way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine eternall life, but by ſo ſound teaching as may bring people to the things here required. But I will here make an end.</p>
               <p>O Lord, graunt that this doctrine which thou haſt taught vs in this thy holy worde, may enter into vs, and dwell in vs for euer: that ſo we may be ſure of thy fauour and of eternall life, through Ieſus Chriſt thy deare ſonne our Lord and onely Sauiour. Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue choſen this portion of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to interpret, becauſe there is very great vſe and commoditie in the true and right vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof: and the doctrine therein contained, is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for all Chriſtians to know. Firſt, becauſe it doth directly and fully ouerthrow &amp; beat downe all carnall profeſsion of the Goſpell, ſhewing that the common and dead faith cannot ſaue a man. Secondly, becauſe it is the principall piller which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21168:93"/>the Papiſts doe leane vnto, and the chiefe place of Scripture which they doe peruert and abuſe, to prooue and eſtabliſh Iuſtification by workes, and the merits of men, and to ouerthrow the free Iuſtification wee haue in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt through faith. The hold which they take in this point, is vpon the ſpeeches and phraſes which the Apoſtle doth vſe: as when he ſaith, <hi>Abraham our father was iustified through workes.</hi> Alſo Rahab the Harlot was iuſtified through workes. Likewiſe ye ſee that of workes a man is iuſtified, and not of faith onely. Herein the two Apoſtles of Chriſt, Saint Paul and Saint Iames, do ſeeme to be flat contrarie the one to the other: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Saint Paul ſaith, Abraham was iuſtified by faith alone, and not by workes; Saint Iames ſaith, he was iuſtified by workes. Saint Paul ſaith, and prooueth by ſundrie and inuincible reaſons, that a man is iuſtified by faith alone without the workes of the law. Saint Iames ſaith, ye ſee that a man is iuſtified by workes, and not by faith only. This contrarietie is but in appearance: for they both wrote by one ſpirite which is alwaies like himſelfe, and alwaies agreeth with himſelfe. The whole blame thereof is to light vpon vs, that wee are ſo dimme ſighted as not to ſee how theſe two ſeruants of GOD doe iumpe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together without any iarre at all. I thinke it needefull for this cauſe before I come to handle the words of the Text as they lye in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, firſt to take away this ſhewe of diſcorde:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21168:94"/>If any man will demaund, what cauſe there was which made them to appeare in outward ſhew ſo contrarie the one to the other? I anſwere, that, although there be no contrarietie in the matter it ſelfe which they teach: yet the diuerſitie of the ſchollers, which they lighted vpon, &amp; the contrary affection of thoſe whom they inſtructed, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to vſe a diuers and contrarie order of teaching.</p>
            <p>Saint Paul hauing to deale with ſuch as would ſeeke to be iuſtified, partly by faith in Chriſt, and partly by their owne deedes, or the deedes of the Law, vſeth this order: firſt, ſhewing that we were loſt and condemned in our ſelues: then next iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaued through the merites of Chriſt: afterward that we are ſanctified in him, and muſt ſhew foorth the fruites of our faith in a pure and holie life. Saint Iames lighting vpon another ſort of men, which confeſſed the free iuſtification through faith in Chriſt, yet in this they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that they did not conſider, how all thoſe that are iuſtified, are ſanctified, how all thoſe that are in chriſt Ieſus, are new creatures, that they are new borne, and walke not after the fleſh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpirit: that the true liuely and iuſtifying faith doth bring foorth the fruites of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a holie conuerſation. Now becauſe this cannot be remooued or ſeparated from the right and liuely faith: Saint Iames goeth as it were backward and prooueth, that where this latter, that is to ſay, the fruites of faith are wanting, there
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21168:94"/>faith is wanting, and ſo his drift is to ſhew that all vngodly and carnall profeſſours of Chriſt, haue but a dead faith, which in no reſpect is able for to helpe or ſaue them. A ſecond cauſe why they ſeeme ſo much to differ, is herein, that men doe not marke well how they handle, not the ſelfe ſame matter, nor haue not the ſame drift. For Saint Paul laboureth to prooue, that the true faith doth ioyne vs to Chriſt, and thereby ſaue vs. Saint Iames here beateth vpon this poynt, that the dead faith which is but a bare image of the right faith cannot profite a man, this ſhall appeare in the wordes of the Text: and alſo a third cauſe is, that they doe not take this word iuſtified in the ſame ſenſe, but diuerſly, as it ſhall bee prooued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Now will I come vnto the Text. <hi>What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth it my brethren, though a man</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hath faith, when he hath no workes, can the faith ſaue him?</hi> This is his propoſition, and the matter which he will diſpute vpon in the whole text fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, thus much it is in effect, that it doth not auaile a man to ſay he hath faith, nor it doth not profit him to boaſt and bragge, and to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion thereof, when he hath no good workes, the reaſon is this, becauſe it cannot ſaue him: marke and obſerue this well, for here at the firſt ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the blindneſſe of the Papiſts, and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, doth manifeſtlie bewray it ſelfe, when as they doe not ſee nor vnderſtand, that it is not the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Apoſtle in this place, to diſpute vpon this point, whether the true faith doth ſaue &amp; iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21168:95"/>or not: but to ſhewe that ſuch as haue not good workes, haue not the true faith in them, and therefore whatſoeuer they profeſſe, they cannot bee ſaued. For hee doth not propound his matter thus: what auaileth it though a man haue faith and haue not workes: but, <hi>What auaileth it though a man ſay, hee hath faith, and hath not workes?</hi> Whereby it is very manifeſt, that when Saint Iames doth attibute the name of faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this dead image, hee doth it not in proper, but in abuſine ſpeech, and after the manner of thoſe men which called it ſaith, when as in very deede it is none, but onely a certaine reſemblance and ſhadowe thereof. Thus much for this enterance and ſtate of his diſputation: now follow his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by which hee doth prooue, that this kinde of faith cannot auaile or profit a man: for hee doth prcoue it very ſtrongly and pithelie. The firſt of them is taken from a compariſon or ſimilitude which hee ſetteth downe thus: <hi>If a brother or a ſister bee naked and destitute of daily foode, and one of you ſay vnto them, Depart in peace, warme your ſelues, and ſill your bellies: notwithstanding ye giue them not thoſe things which are needfull to the booie, what helpeth it?</hi> This is the ſumme of the matter: There commeth vnto you a poore man or a poore woman which lacketh clothes and ſuſtenance; you giue them gentle and faire words, God helpe ye, God ſuccour ye, and ſend yee releefe, but yee giue them nothing: can this helpe the poore man, or the poore woman? Shall
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21168:95"/>they not for all your louing words ſterue for cold and dye for hunger, if euery man ſhould ſerue them ſo, and giue them no other almes? Why doe ye not ſee then, that as this almes and liberalitie to the poore, which is but in faire ſpeeches, is colde, and doth not helpe: ſo in like manner the faith which is but in words and outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpeech, although it be with neuer ſo great bragges, is dead: and then further why doe ye not vnderſtand that a thing which is weake and dead in it ſelfe, can by no meanes haue power to giue life and to ſaue? But obſerue it a little better, thus the compariſon ſtandeth: if that liberalitie which is onely in words bee cold or dead, and doth not profite the poore, nor make him a liberall man which vſeth it, then it followeth alſo, that that faith which is onely in ſpeech is dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſaue or profite him which hath it: if words onely could profite or cauſe it to be faith, why ſhould not words alſo profit the poore man or woman which is deſtitute? If words onely can make a faithful man, why ſhuld not words make a liberall man? If for a man to ſay he hath faith, be of that power to do the greateſt things, as namely to couple vs to Chriſt, to raiſe the ſoule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life, to put the diuell to flight, &amp; to ouercome the world, ſhould it not be able to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſer, that is to ſay, ſo far to preuaile with vs, &amp; to haue ſuch power in vs, as to bring forth good works? Deere brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, know that if it be aliue &amp; do the former, it muſt needs do this: if it do not this latter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21168:96"/>it is dead, and can doe nothing to ſaue vs. This is a moſt plaine and forcible reaſon to proue, that the faith of a carnall and worldly Goſpeller, is but a dead ſhew of faith, and therefore he is not iuſtified nor ſaued, neither can be iuſtified nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereby: ſeeing it hath no life in it ſelfe to worke and to bring foorth fruites, it cannot giue life vnto him: for how ſhould it bring that which it hath not? To ſet it foorth more plainly, thus the Apoſtle addeth: but ſome man might ſay, thou haſt the faith, and I haue workes, ſhew mee thy faith by thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes. He ſheweth here, how euerie ſimple man which is a true Chriſtian may be able to deale againſt the greateſt and moſt ſkilfull Doctor that is, to prooue that hee hath no faith if he haue not good works: for when he ſaith, <hi>Some man will ſay,</hi> it is as much, as if he had ſayd, any man may ſay, <hi>thou haſt faith,</hi> that is, thou makeſt thy boaſt that thou haſt faith, ſhewe it by thy workes: becauſe faith is an holy thing, wrought by Gods ſpirite, and a liuely and mightie thing, therefore it cannot be without holy and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For as a man is knowne to bee dead, when he doth not breathe, cannot ſtirre, ſee, heare, and ſuch like; and contrariwiſe, when hee doth any of theſe, he is knowne to bee aliue: euen ſo is it with faith, if it can or do bring foorth no good works, then is it dead: on the contrary part, the actions and ſtirring thereof, doe ſhew it to be aliue. This is a ſtrong place againſt all thoſe which doe not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21168:96"/>onely vaunt themſelues of a vaine and dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, but alſo would leaue no mark to know who are of God and who are of the diuell: Let a man take them tardie in any foule vice, wherein they wallow, and ſay vnto them, ye are out of the way, ye haue not the true beleefe in God, ye are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, ye are a worldling, ye are a drunkard, and an adulterer, or ſuch like, their anſwere is readie: Who made you able to iudge? can you tell how I beleeue? will you take vpon you to ſee what is in my heart? whatſoeuer you ſay, I haue as good a beleefe as your ſelfe. Marke well now I pray ye, for here ye may learne how to anſwere ſuch ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: ſay thus vnto them, Faith indeed of it ſelfe is a ſecret thing in the heart, but yet becauſe it can no more be without good deedes, then fire can be without heat; the Lord doth bid vs by his Apoſtle to ſay vnto you, ſhewe mee your faith by your workes, and when your tongue is foule and your deedes are wicked, moſt certain it is that the heart is vncleane, &amp; there is no right faith: for that doth purge the heart, as S. Peter ſaith, Act. 15. <hi>Looke but vpon mens words and outward brags of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, and ye would thinke there were ſuch plentie of faith, that there could be almoſt no more, euery man doth ſo ſtrongly beleeue in Chriſt.</hi> But come to this touchſtone and triall which is here giuen vs, <hi>ſhew thy faith by thy workes,</hi> and it ſhall by and by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vs ſo farre on the other ſide, when wee ſee ſuch flouds of all horrible and beaſtly ſinnes, that it will cauſe vs to thinke vpon this ſaying: When the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21168:97"/>ſonne of man commeth, ſhall he finde faith vpon the earth? For if this be true, as it is moſt true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God himſelfe hath ſet it downe: that the faith which is without good workes is dead, and thoſe are Infidels, which like bruit beaſts care not but for the things of this world, and make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of committing all kinde of euill workes? Doe ye ſuppoſe that if the ſonne of man ſhould now come, that he ſhould finde any great ſtore of faith? Alas, alas, how many are the ſinfull deedes of the moſt men, which ſhew that they haue no faith? How few are the good workes, and how weake euen in the ſmall remnant of the godlie, which doth declare how poore and ſlender their faith is? But wee muſt yet proceede further in this matter, and as it were ſtrike it a little deeper. As men are wilie to deceiue themſelues, ſo they will here yet finde a hole to creepe out at, although they bee neuer ſo wicked: for thus they will ſay. It is true, Gods worde ſaith, that faith is ſhewed foorth by good workes: well, I thanke GOD, though I haue many vices in mee, and am full of infirmities, yet I am not altogether without good workes: I am not ſo graceleſſe, but at ſome times I remember GOD by prayer: I doe according to my abilitie giue to the poore: I am readie to pleaſure my friend: doe not theſe things ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhewe that I haue faith? Dearely beloued, take heede, for here you may ſoone bee deceiued, it is not the meaning of the Apoſtle when hee ſaith, <hi>ſhew me thy faith by thy workes,</hi> that a fewe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21168:97"/>ſcattered ſcrappes of good deedes among great heapes of ſinfull workes, and as it were a fewe grains of corne in a great heap of chaffe, ſhuld be a true witneſſe of the ſame. For it muſt be ſhewed both in forſaking and renouncing all euill waies, and alſo in following after all goodneſſe: for it is without all controuerſie, that thoſe which ſeeme to bee good workes before men, are not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD, in the man which is giuen ouer to commit ſinne: can that which is good come out of the ſame heart, in which vngodlineſſe raigneth? Either make the tree good (ſaith Chriſt) and the fruite good, or els make the tree euill, and the fruit euill: A good tree cannot bring foorth euill fruite,
<note place="margin">Matt. 12.13 Luk. 6.43.</note> neither can an euill tree bring foorth good fruite. Can the ſame tree bring forth both good fruit &amp; euill fruite? Doth a fountaine at the ſame place (ſaith S. Iames) ſend foorth both ſweete and bitter water?
<note place="margin">Iames 3.11. 1. Iohn 3.7.</note> Be not deceiued (ſaith Saint Iohn) he that worketh righteouſneſſe is righteous, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſinne is of the diuell. Some man will ſay, doth not the moſt godly man that liueth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne, and doeth not the good and the bad come together from him? The godly are loden with the corruptions of the fleſh, but yet they doe not commit ſinne, that is to ſay, they are not giuen ouer, as vngodly men are, to the obedience of ſinne: they are ſpotted with imperfections, but they doe not take pleaſure therein as the wicked doe: although they feele a lumpiſhneſſe in them vnto good workes, yet their whole race is applied
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21168:98"/>vnto good workes: they would very faine obey their God on both ſides, that is to ſay, in forſaking all that is euill, and doing all that which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them. Contrariwiſe, the fleſhly Infidell doeth with all his heart giue vp himſelfe in the whole race of his life to that which is filthie; if hee doe any thing which is good, it is but in ſhew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not done ſincerely, nor comming from a good roote: but of ſelfe-loue, vaine glorie, or ſuch like; hee doth not any thing for the Lords ſake, but for his owne. For loue him, and ye ſhall finde him readie to doe you good: ceaſe that, and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth dye. Praiſe him, hee will praiſe you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, diſcommend him, although hee deſerue it neuer ſo much, ye ſhall not come in his bookes, be ye neuer ſo good. Forget not this then I pray yee good brethren, when God hath ſet down ſo plain a rule to trie our ſelues by, whether we be faithfull or Infidels. If wee finde our ſelues full of good workes, and our heart doth beare vs witneſſe that we doe them euen for loue towards God: well are we, this doth declare our faith. But if our euil deeds abound, and our heart bee vncleane, it is time to looke about vs, wee are in a moſt miſerable caſe. I wiſh of GOD, that wee might often thinke vpon this, and be careful to ſhew our faith to the world, by our good and pure life. Be not afraid to applie this to our ſelues, and alſo to deale againſt the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly with it. For in this diſſolute age, wherein iniquitie hath almoſt gotten the vpper hand, it is moſt neceſſarie that we vſe this inſtrument which
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21168:98"/>God hath put in our hands. <hi>Thou ſaiſt thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, ſhew thy faith by thy workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now followeth another reaſon. <hi>Thou beleeueſt there is one God: thou doeſt well: the diuels alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and tremble.</hi> Way this argument well, &amp; ye ſhall plainly perceiue, that it doth nothing at all helpe a man to ſay he hath faith, when he hath no good deedes: if this kinde of faith could ſaue him, then ſhould the diuels be ſaued alſo, becauſe they haue the ſame beleefe: but becauſe it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the diuels ſhall not thereby bee ſaued, therefore it is alſo as manifeſt, that thoſe men who haue no other beleefe, but that which they haue, cannot bee ſaued. Let vs ſee then how farre the faith of Diuels doth goe. <hi>Thou beleeueſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there is one God, or that God is one,</hi> and ſo thou thinkeſt this a great matter, not to beleeue as the vaine Gentiles, which did thinke there were diuers gods, and indeede for ſo farre thou doeſt well: but yet marke what a great matter thou haſt attained, the Diuels doe beleeue the ſame, and yet haue thereby no benefite or reconciliation with GOD, for they tremble when they remember the terrible iudgement ſeate and the euerlaſting fire which is prepared for them. This faith of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels is not to be reſtrained to ſome one poynt, but ſtretcheth vnto the whole doctrine of Faith. They doe ſtedfaſtly beleeue and know that Ieſus Chriſt dyed for the ſinnes of the world: this is a ſure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they know the doctrine of GOD, when they ſeeke to deface and ouerthrow it by contrary
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:21168:99"/>errors. When a man therefore is of a ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Scriptures for matters of faith, and is able to confirme euerie poynt, and to ouerthrow the contrarie errours: though many will ſay, hee is a ſound man, and hee taketh himſelfe to bee as great a Goſpeller as any other, yet if hee haue no workes, if his faith bee not a liuely regenerating ſaith, hee may eſteeme of himſelfe what he will, but the Lord telleth vs that hee is no more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde then the diuels, they are as founde in the knowledge of trueth as he. And if this common and generall faith would ſerue, they ſhould bee ſaued as well as hee. But it may bee here obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that there is great difference betweene the faith of Diuels, and the faith of thoſe men which beleeue, and yet haue no fruites of godlineſſe in them. The Diuels indeede doe beleeue all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith to bee true, but they doe not nor can not beleeue, that they pertaine any thing at all to them, they haue no hope of mercie: but men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee very ſinfull, yet they are in hope that they ſhall bee ſaued. Heere is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence therfore, &amp; the faith of ſuch men goeth far beyond the faith of Diuels. The Lord giue vs eyes to ſee, and hearts to vnderſtand, for I will ſhew that the difference is, That the faith of the Diuels is more perfect: For what is the cauſe that the Diuels haue no hope, and the wicked men thinke they haue hope? Is it becauſe they haue leſſe faith? Nay, it is becauſe they are more wiſe, and becauſe they giue credite to that which GOD
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21168:99"/>hath threatned againſt them. They beleeue that hee will powre out his wrath vpon them becauſe hee hath ſayd it: but the wicked men they are more fooliſh, and where GOD hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them for their ſinnes eternall fire, they doe not beleeue him, and ſo indeede their faith commeth ſhort of the faith of Diuels: they ſhould beleeue the Lord when hee telleth them that all thoſe which doe not turne from their vngodlineſſe, when hee calleth them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſhall bee caſt into Hell. But they blind themſelues, and will ſeeme to beleeue quite contrarie vnto that which GOD affirmeth: this is not to ſhut the doore to repentance, but to mooue men to ſeeke for it, while GOD doth offer himſelfe: for they ſhall not bee able when they will. It is GOD which muſt beget vs to himſelfe, and giue vs the newe birth, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie vs by his ſpirite, to bring foorth the true fruites of faith, and not to haue ſuch a dead beleefe which doeth chaunge vs, no more then the faith which the Diuelles haue, doth chaunge them. For there bee verie manie at this day, who being ſtuffed as full of wickedneſſe as euer they can hold, and their words and deedes doe plainly ſhew that they are no more changed then diuels, which will ſo brag of their faith, and the ſtrength thereof, that if there ſhould be but tenne in the whole Countrie ſaued, they hope to be of them: they neuer vnderſtood the doctrine which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord teacheth in this place: God giue vs vnderſtanding
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:21168:100"/>that we be not ſeduced, but that wee may ſeeke at the hands of Chriſt, to giue vs a faith which may differ from that which the diuels haue. Here alſo ſhall appeare the ignorance of the Papiſts: They would beare men in hand, that Saint Iames doth ſpeak of the ſame faith, which Saint Paul doth, and that he plainly affirmeth it doth not alone iuſtifie. But ſee here as he ſaid before, <hi>What auaileth it if a man ſay he hath faith and hath no workes, can that faith which is but in words, or the dead faith ſaue him?</hi> So now hee telleth more plainly, what faith it is which he ſpeaketh of, which cannot helpe a man, euen that which the diuell hath. Is not that beleefe which S. Paul ſaith doth iuſtifie, wrought by the holie Ghoſt? Shall we bee ſo blaſphemous as to ſay the Diuels are partakers of him? You may well perceiue therefore that Saint Iames doeth ſpeake nothing againſt that which Saint Paul hath prooued, how Chriſt alone is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, whom wee take holde of onelie by Faith: for hee doeth but ſhewe that the dead picture of Faith doeth not ſaue. Remember well then what Faith is here ſpoken of, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is ſoone decided.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle now proceedeth to his laſt reaſon, which becauſe it is wonderfull ſtrong, he vſeth as it were a certaine Preface vnto it, leaſt we ſhould paſſe lightly ouer it, without due conſideration. <hi>But wilt thou vnderstand</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>O thou vaine man, that the faith which is without works is dead?</hi> See how vehemently hee thundereth here againſt
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21168:100"/>the carnall profeſſour, calling him a vaine man, likewiſe wilt thou vnderſtand, can not thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſons ſatisfie thee, are they not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to perſwade thee, or plaine enough to teach thee? I will let thee ſee ſuch a reaſon, that neither thou norall the world, ſhall be able for to gainſay, it is ſo ſtrong and ſo manifeſt, that it will ſtoppe the mouthes of all the cauillers: and force them to confeſſe, will they nill they, that the faith that is without workes is dead. See how maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly the holy ghoſt doth labor to driue vs from truſting to this broken ſtaffe, and to force vs to ſeeke after the true and right beleefe, if wee haue any care to ſaue our ſoules. And doubtleſſe daily experience doeth teach vs how needefull a thing this is. For the greateſt number of profeſſours thinke nothing leſſe needful then to ſeek increaſe of faith: they ſuppoſe and they will ſay, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue well enough, they feele no want at all, what ſhould preaching doe, they can but beleeue. In very deed this dead faith of theirs, ſeemes to them to be verie ſtrong, it cannot be ſhaken, neither is it tried or tempted, for to what purpoſe ſhould the Deuill much labour to ouerthrowe it: but thoſe which haue any faith indeed, do feele what neede there is to vſe all meanes to ſtrengthen it. But let vs come to the matter; hee prooueth now by examples, that the true faith is knowen by good workes: the firſt example is of Abraham: thus it is to be opened: yee know that Abraham was an holy man, and a right man indeede, hee
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21168:101"/>was highly in fauour with God, the couenant was made with him, that in his ſeede all nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed: ye will then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that hee had the right faith, there is no doubt at all in that. Likewiſe ye muſt needs graunt, that as there is but one God, one mediatour, ſo there is but one faith: whereupon it followeth, that as many as haue ſuch a faith, or the ſame faith which was in Abraham ſhall be ſaued, and none els: for although euery one of the children of Abraham doe not attaine to the ſame meaſure and ſtrength that their father did,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.5. 1. Tim. 2.5.</note> yet they are like him, and haue the ſame beleefe. Then I beſeech you, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue well the ſecond part, wherein is declared how the faith of Abraham was fruitfull, and did declare and ſhewe forth it ſelfe by good workes,
<note place="margin">Gen. 21.</note> for hee offered his ſonne Iſaac vpon the Altar. Whereupon it doeth alſo follow that all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and all the ſonnes of God, doe declare and ſhewe forth their faith, by their good deeds. And whoſoeuer they be which doe not ſo, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates and baſtards, none of his children, nor yet partakers of any bleſſing with him, for their faith is dead, and therefore they are not aliue: do you not ſee, dearly beloued, the marueilous force of this reaſon, and that it is as cleere as the ſunne? Heere is no ſtarting hole left for a man to hide himſelfe in, nor to creepe out at, but hee is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den faſt to this, that if hee will be ſaued, he muſt ſo beleeue, that he declare and ſhew forth to the worlde by his good workes an holy life, how hee
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21168:101"/>walketh in the ſteps of his faithfull father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. But why doth he chooſe this one worke of Abraham before all the reſt? For his life did ſhine with holy workes, he was mercifull to the poore, he entertained &amp; lodged ſtrangers, he was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with all men, iuſt and true in all his dealings: doubtleſſe this did excell all the reſt, and ſo farre paſſe them, that it may well enough be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inſtead of them all, it did declare a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full faith and loue towards God, as we may eaſily ſee, conſidering all the whole circumſtances of the ſtorie. God hath called him out of his natiue country, and from his fathers houſe, into a ſtrange land: hee had promiſed him a ſonne by his wife Sara, of whome the bleſſed ſeed ſhould come; he performed this promiſe in his old age, euen when Sara was by nature paſt childbearing,
<note place="margin">Gen. 21.12.</note> he had no other child by her, the promiſe was made in none but in him. In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeede be bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Ech man ſhall now be driuen to confeſſe, that here was a great triall, when God doeth bid him take his onely ſonne, euen Iſaac, and goe three daies iourney to the place which he would ſhew him, and to offer him vpon the altar a ſlaine ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. How great a griefe is it for a louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to looſe a ſonne which hee loueth dearely, eſpecially when hee hath no more ſonnes? then how much griefe might this be, not onely to ſee his ſonne ſlaine, but alſo to ſlay him with his owne handes: and moſt of all that childe, in whome the couenant of eternall life was made,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21168:102"/>becauſe Chriſt ſhould come of him, who beeing dead, all hope of ſaluation did die with him. All this did not withhold, but the faith of Abraham carried ſo great a loue in him and feare towardes God, that hee neuer grudged at the matter, nor neuer made delay, but went indeed to haue ſlain his ſonne, hauing bound him vpon the wood, and hauing taken in his hand the ſacrificing knife, to kill him. Then the Angell of the Lord from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen did forbid him. Before the Lorde it was as if it had been done, becauſe Abraham did fully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to doe it: then wee ſee plainly by this, what the true faith is. But if any man ſhould obiect and ſay, this example is not fit, euerie man can not be like Abraham, nor haue ſuch a faith as hee had, hee was a rare man, few or none to be compared with him: Saint Iames doth anſwer, If ye thinke this example to be too high, and that yee are not to be meaſured by it, I will ſhewe you another as low: what ſay yee to Rahab the harlot, was not ſhee iuſtified by workes, did not her faith declare it ſelfe by good workes? Can ye take any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt this example? Will yee not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that your faith ſhould not be like hers? As the faith of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did vtter it ſelfe to the world, ſo did hers, whereby ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe to be a right daughter of Abraham, although ſhee were not of his poſteritie according to the fleſh, but came of one of thoſe curſed nations, which God had commaunded the children of Iſrael to roote out and deſtroy, yet I ſay, ſhee was his daughter,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21168:102"/>according as Saint Paul ſetteth it forth in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Romanes, that hee ſhould be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not onely of them which are of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, but alſo of thoſe that walke in the ſteps of the faith of our father Abraham: like as all his children both of the Iewes and Gentiles muſt doe, which will be bleſſed with their faithfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham. Then wee haue here the example of the father of all the faithfull, with the example of one of his daughters, which had been a poore harlot, what excuſe remaineth, or what can wee pretend, ſhall wee not bluſh, and be aſhamed to ſay that we beleeue well, and take our ſelues to be the children of Abraham and the children of God, when we are no more like him, then (as the common ſaying is) an apple is like an oiſter? Chriſt our Sauiour doeth vſe this reaſon againſt the Phariſies in the Goſpell of Saint Iohn, If yee were Abrahams children (ſaith he) ye would doe the workes of Abraham: but now you go about to kill mee, a man that hath tolde you the trueth which I haue heard of God: this did not Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. And a little after: Ye are of your father the deuill, and the luſtes of your father yee will doe. What would ye haue more plaine than this? Euen the verie ſeed and poſteritie of Abraham, which tooke themſelues to be the children of Abraham and the children of God, yet Chriſt Ieſus telleth them plainely they are the children of the deuill, and why? Becauſe their workes were not like the workes of Abraham, their beliefe was not like
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21168:103"/>his, but it was dead. Shall wee not then as boldly ſay at this day, nay rather, doth not Chriſt ſpeake as plainly as he did? and telleth vngodly men to their face, howſoeuer yee bragge of your faith, it is but dead: and howſoeuer yee boaſt and take your ſelues to be the children of God, yet in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deede, vnleſſe yee returne from your vngodly waies, and ſhew forth the fruites of a true &amp; liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, yee are the children of the deuill: truſt not vnto your vaine hope and deade faith, for it will but deceiue you. Dearely beloued, let vs not be ſo mad, when God telleth vs this with his own mouth, as to beleeue the contrarie, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelues wee ſhall doe well enough, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we continue in our ſinnes. This is a moſt peſtilent craft of Sathan, and commeth from the roote of Infidelitie, as yee may ſee in our great grandmother Eue: God had told her and Adam, that what day ſoeuer they ſhould eate of the tree, they ſhould die the death: the deuill told her, yee ſhall not die, ſhe beleeued him, but beleeued not God, ſhee thought euen as the deuill tolde her, ſhee ſhould doe well enough, or els ſhee would neuer haue eate thereof: we haue ſucked this poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from her breaſtes: when God telleth vs, if your faith bring not foorth good workes, it is deade, it can not helpe yee, if yee continue in theſe wicked deedes, yee are the children of the deuill yee muſt ſpeedily repent, for yee can not when yee would. No, no, ſaith the deuill on the other ſide, that is not true, your faith is good
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21168:103"/>enough, goe on, yee ſhall doe well, God hath mercie in ſtore, yee may repent afterward. Now the moſt doeth beleeue the deuill in this, and giue no credit at all vnto God, and neuer ſeeke to trie themſelues, whether they be in good caſe or not.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle ſaith here, that Abraham was iuſtified by workes, and that Rahab was iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by workes, &amp;c. Wee muſt note that this word Iuſtified is taken diuers waies in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is one cauſe (as I noted before) why Saint Paul and Saint Iames ſeeme to be contrary; Saint Paul proouing that we are iuſtified by faith, taketh it as contrarie to this worde condemned, for being by our ſinnes guiltie, and to receiue the ſentence of condemnation, we are in Chriſt (into whoſe myſticall body wee are incorporate tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough faith) acquit and diſcharged, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led iuſtification: this cannot be by the workes of the lawe, becauſe there is no perfection in the deedes of any, but euen the moſt pure are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and ſpotted. Therefore as Saint Paul ſaith, they are all vnder the curſe, which holde of the workes of the law: for it is written, Curſed is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one which continueth not in all things which are written in the booke of the lawe to doe them. The reaſon of this is to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the moſt holy and pure nature of God, vnto whome no vncleane thing can be coupled, no vnpure thing (although it be but in part) can abide his preſence, or haue fellowſhip with him.</p>
            <pb n="208" facs="tcp:21168:104"/>
            <p>The word Iuſtifie, is alſo taken in this ſenſe, as when a man doth declare and ſhewe forth before men, that hee is a righteous perſon alſo before God: and that is the meaning of the word in this place, that looke how by faith wee are iuſtified before God: ſo by the fruits of our faith, wee are iuſtified, that is, declared to bee iuſt before men.</p>
            <p>For proofe that the Scripture doeth vſe the word Iuſtified in this fenſe, looke vpon the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Dauid. <hi>That thou maieſt be iustified in thy ſaying, and pure when thou iudgest:</hi> there it can ſignifie no more but that God might ſhewe and declare himſelfe to be iuſt. In the Goſpell of Saint Luke chap. 16. verſ. 15. <hi>You are they</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Phariſies) <hi>which iuſtifie your ſelues before men, but God doth know your hearts.</hi> In this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is moſt apparant, that there is a iuſtifying before men, which the Phariſies in coloured hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie did ſeeke for; but Chriſt telleth them, they were neuer the better, becauſe they were not of vpright heart before God. The word is alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in another ſenſe, which I omit. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will now demand how it can be prooued, that Saint Iames doth vſe it in this latter ſenſe rather then in the former? I anſwer, that the verie place it ſelfe, and goe no further, doeth declare this thing: for when the Apoſtle ſaith thus, <hi>Some man will ſay, ſhew me thy faith by thy workes,</hi> is it not apparant, that hee ſpeaketh of that which is before men or declared vnto men, and not of that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:21168:104"/>God? In like manner, when he ſaith, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was iuſtified by workes, when hee offered his ſonne Iſaac vpon the altar. Doth not the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſhewe, that before God Abraham was iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified long before by faith? If it be obiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that it may alſo be ſaid, how hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time iuſtified before men, or that hee had ſhewed by his deeds vnto men, that hee did feare and loue God, and then what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that it may bee taken for a more full and perfect iuſtification, or an increaſe thereof, as wel before God as before men? I anſwere, that before God a man beeing iuſtified, to ſpeake properly there is no increaſe thereof, for hee is fully and wholly diſcharged and acquite, or els it is no iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. But becauſe wee haue receiued the grace of iuſtification but in part and not in full meaſure, therefore our iuſtifying before men is more and more declared by degrees, as good workes doe more and more abound in vs, and ſo Abraham was by this one worke more iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before men, then by all the reſt of his deedes, and therefore it may well be ſet downe in ſtead of all the reſt We ſee here then that becauſe by the ſcriptures this muſt needs be taken for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of iuſtification in our father Abraham, that it muſt neceſſarily be vnderſtood of that iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which is before men: ye ſee now the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this text and the drift and ſcope of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is laid open vnto ye, but my chiefe purpoſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21168:105"/>is yet behinde, and that wherein wee are to be wrought vpon yet remaineth, which is a more particular application and handling of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For we muſt not paſſe away thus with the matter, vnleſſe we mind to take ſmall fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>Yee will confeſſe theſe things which I haue handled to be true, as of neceſſitie we are forced thereunto, wee can not but graunt that the holy Ghoſt hath giuen a perfect touchſtone: then am I to exhort you in the name of God, &amp; as ye ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and loue the ſaluation of your ſoules, to giue attentiue heede a little, and not to let this thing ſlip away from yee: Doe ye graunt that the faith which is without workes is dead? and that it is no better then the faith of deuils? And yet will yee ſtill ſuppoſe, that idolators, ſwearers, railers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, couetous worldlings, and griping v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, and ſuch like are in good caſe, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, can hope for mercie? Doe yee confeſſe that there is but one true faith, which was the faith of Abraham and Rahab? Doe yee alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the ſame faith in them did ſhew it ſelfe by good deedes? And will yee ſtill accept it for a ſufficient proofe of a good and ſound te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of a true beleefe, when any man can ſay, I doe hurt no man, I liue vprightly, and pay euery man his owne, I haue alwaies beene repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and taken for an honeſt man, what would ye require more of me, I liue as my neighbours doe,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21168:105"/>I truſt God will hold me excuſed, although hee haue no regard of any obedience to the worde of God, to conſider wherein his glorie doth conſiſt, nor yet any care of men, to profite either their ſoules or their bodies: but contenteth himſelfe with this, if hee doe them no good, to do them no harme.</p>
            <p>I will ſhewe you dearely beloued, how theſe ſorts of people are declued by two foule errors, which this text doth moſt ſtrongly ouerthrowe: the firſt is this, that they looke but vnto men, and reſtraine their dutie vnto them, whereas they ſhoulde chiefely looke vnto that which they owe vnto God, and then to that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to their breethren: the ſecond is, that they ſuppoſe themſelues bound no further but to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from hurting, without regard of doing the duties of loue, wherein one man is to profit and further another.</p>
            <p>As concerning the firſt of theſe, both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Abraham, and alſo of Rahab, doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly conuince them, becauſe the fruites of their faith or the workes whereby they were iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, did not ſo much reſpect man as God, for in Abraham there appeareth only a loue towards God, for whoſe ſake he was contented to forget the affection of a father, &amp; to ſhew that although he loued Iſaac dearly, yet he loued God more: ſo that if we feel our loue to the Lord our god, to be ſo ſmall that it can not preuaile with vs, to kill &amp;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:21168:106"/>mortifie the luſtes of ſinne, and vaine pleaſures of the fleſh: how ſhall we perſwade our ſelues that wee are like Abraham, which had denyed the loue of himſelfe ſo farre, that he did neuer grudge, but would willingly haue killed his ſonne: Rahab after ſhee had made confeſſion what ſhe did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue concerning the God of Iſrael, for the ſame Gods ſake, for the true religion, &amp; for the Church and people of God, tooke the meſſengers &amp; did hide them, to the hazard of her life and all that ſhee had, affirming to the king when hee ſent to ſeeke them, that they were departed. Doeth not this improoue the faith of thoſe which for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of GOD are ſo farre off from hazarding their liues and goods, that they dare not be ſeene when neuer ſo little danger doth ariſe? wherein are thoſe like vnto Rahab, which will turne with euery winde? and a man can not tell what reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they be of: they will be ſure to row with the tide, and neuer to ſtriue againſt the ſtreame: doe ſuch now iuſtifie them ſelues like Rahab? haue they ſuch a faith as ſhee had? No deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued, they are as yet verie infidels, and loue them ſelues and the worlde, more then they loue GOD and his truth: this thing then is moſt euident, that the true beleefe doth make all thoſe that haue it, ready and willing to loſe their liues and their goods for the Goſpell: this muſt not ſeeme to be a ſtrange doctrine, when as our Sauiour telleth vs in ſundry places, that hee that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21168:106"/>doth not forſake all, and take vp his croſſe and follow him, can not be his diſciple. Well, wee muſt therefore be ſo hote and zealous in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of true religion, that it cauſe vs to forget our owne ſtate and commoditie: we muſt haue ſo burning a loue to Gods trueth, that nothing may be able to quench the ſame. Wee muſt not ſtagger and varie, becauſe wee ſhall endure trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Let vs conclude this point, wherein it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that they erre and are deceiued, which do not make account of keeping religion pure, of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it before all other things, and ſo of giuing to God his due honour. Remember that from hence ye are to fetch the firſt part of the true deſcription of a godly man, and the triall of the iuſtifying faith which is but one, and therefore worketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in all which are partakers of it, though not in the like meaſure, and withall marke how farre the holy ghoſt doth differ in ſetting forth a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man from the common manner of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, whereas he taketh it to be the chiefe worke which reſpecteth God himſelfe &amp; his truth: they paſſe ouer that, and count it no matter though a man be an idolater, or ſuperſtitious, or a ſwearer, which doeth not reuerence the name of God, ſo that hee be a friendly man to his friend, and ſuch like, how great an enemie he be to the worde of God, it skilleth not: theſe are bruit beaſts without vnderſtanding, verie Atheiſtes, which will ſay plainly they can ſee no difference betweene the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21168:107"/>papiſts and the profeſſours of the goſpell: both becauſe they are not able to iudge of doctrine, and alſo that they look but vnto men. Now let vs come to the ſecond thing wherein they erre, and which this text doth confute ſharply: they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as I told ye) that men are to haue no further regard but to this, not to hurt, paſſing by all thoſe duties, wherein they are to doe good vnto their brethren, not duly conſidering how the lawe of God doth not only bind vs to abſtaine from hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our neighbour, but alſo doth moſt ſtraigtly tie vs to doe all good deeds vnto them: ſo that he is guilty before God, not only which committeth that which the lawe forbiddeth, but alſo which leaueth the thing vndone which the law inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Now then becauſe the true faith bringeth vs to haue care to obey God wholly. Saint lames requireth that a man ſhould ſhewe his faith, not onely by leauing that which is euill, but alſo by the perfourmance of that which is good: for thus he ſaith, Shew me thy faith by thy deeds: and that faith which is without workes is dead. Here by the way obſerue by compariſon, how farre off are thoſe from grace, which ſwarme full of vncleane vices, and their whole race is nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſinning: whereas this is euidently here prooued, that ſuch men as carrie a great ſhewe of vprightnes, in refraining from ſundrie vices, are ſtill without teſtimonie of true beleefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their holy deeds doe not appeare, for when
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21168:107"/>as the holy ſcriptures doe teſtifie, that the heart is purified by faith, that thoſe are borne againe in the new and ſpirituall birth, that they are new creatures, and haue a new heart, and a right ſpirit, created and renued in them, it muſt needs be that they are prepared vnto euery good worke, they haue not only put off the olde man with his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt luſtes, but haue alſo put on the new man, which is created in righteouſnes &amp; true holines: &amp; as they haue walked in darkenes, ſo now they walke in the light. There is one ſtep yet further in this matter, I truſt that as yee will confeſſe this, That if thoſe doe not beleeue well which haue no good workes to ſhewe, although they bee in ſome things vpright, and much more the foule &amp; filthy liuers which diſhonour God and his truth: ſo ye will alſo be brought to ſee, that thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men are yet further off, which barke againſt this holy doctrine, and can not abide that a man ſhould ſay to the wicked and vngodly, thou art in the way to hell, thou ſhalt die the death, if thou returne not from theſe euils. They may thunder and raile againſt men, and ſay they vtter damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but let them looke if they can quench the light which the holy ghoſt hath giuen in this text. Let vs returne to the former matter againe. Wee muſt not only abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euil, but alſo do good: there be many likewiſe deceiued in their doing good, reſtraining it to the baſer and leſſer part: they looke but vnto the bodies of their brethren,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:21168:108"/>and ſuppoſe they are to haue no further regard but of them, to relieue and eaſe the miſeries of the fleſh, let the ſoule be neuer ſo blind, neuer ſo ſick, in neuer ſo great danger of eternall deſtruction, they haue no pitie of that, which doeth bewray that they ſee no further then this life, they haue no true loue nor pitie in them, for then would they loue the ſoules of men, which are ſo precious, they would pitie the wofull miſerie that they be in. For how abſurd a thing is this, that one ſhould be carefull to caſe the calamitie which laſteth but for a day, and not reſpect that which is eternall? I muſt therfore here againe admoniſh ye, that ſuch as will haue proofe of their faith by good workes, muſt exerciſe the ſame as well to the ſoules as to the bodies of men, and becauſe therin doth ſtand the greateſt loue of all other, they are therein to ſhew themſelues moſt earneſt. There is no more excellent note of faith, and of the true feare and loue of God, then when a man is grieued, and mourneth to ſee men out of the way to life, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning headlong in their ſinnes vnto deſtruction, and when as he doth in loue and pitie admoniſh them, and ſeeke by inſtruction to draw them out of the ſnares of the deuill. On the contrary ſide, hee can neuer ſay he hath any droppe of grace, which delighteth and ſporteth himſelfe, at the lewde and wanton behauiour of other men. Iudge deare brethren theſe Cockbraines, which can not be merrie, but at the ſinfull and prophane
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21168:108"/>ſpeeches of vaine men: doe they ſhew the fruites of faith? Thoſe abominable beaſts, which delight to make men dronk, to the intent they may laugh: are they of GOD, or of the diuell? We muſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently exerciſe the contrarie, labouring to draw one another to God: and to conuert their ſoules which goe aſtray: which is the ſpeciall and chiefe good work that we can doe vnto men. To feed the hungrie, to clothe the naked, to viſit the ſicke, and thoſe which are in bonds, to open as it were the bowels of mercie and compaſsion to all that are in miſerie, are very excellent and glorious fruites of faith, and haue great promiſes of reward in the holie Scriptures; yet are they not comparable to theſe, when the ſoule is ſicke in priſon, and in the chaines of Satan, to viſit and releeue it. When it is pining away for want of heauenly foode, to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnto it: when it is full of grieuous ſores and deadly wounds, to giue holeſome medicines and ſalues vnto it, to mourne with the bowels of pitie and compaſsion for it. From hence it ariſeth that all true faithfull hearts doe ſobbe and groane with ſorrow, when they ſee men left without inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and when they behold the deſolations and ruines of the Church, it doth pinch them euen at the heart, it cauſeth bitter teares to flow out of their eyes, when they behold any famine &amp; death of the food of life: and when they ſee them runne from ſea to ſea, &amp; from the one end of the land to the other to ſeeke for it. When they ſee the young
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21168:109"/>man and the beautifull virgin periſh for thirſt, he that ſhall deny this, or ſtand in doubt thereof, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew as yet what the vſe and benefite of the worde is, nor yet what that loue in the ſpirit is, which the Lord commendeth vnto vs. I might here ſtand long in particulars, to ſhew the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thoſe parents, which ſuffer their children to be without the knowledge of God, and to periſh in their ſinnes. For one of the chiefe fruits of their faith doth ſtand in this which the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth.

Gods word pronounceth them bleſſed, which imploy their goods to feede the poore: then how much more bleſſed a thing is it when they are imployed to the miniſtring of ſpirituall foode, which neuer periſheth? But let
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:21168:109"/>vs come to thoſe which haue the charge of ſoules, what is the principall good worke, which they are to ſhewe their faith by: and wherein they are to declare their loue towards Chriſt and his Church.
<note place="margin">Iohn 21.15</note> 
               <hi>Simon Ioanna</hi> loueſt thou me? Feede my ſheepe, feede my Lambes, feede my ſheepe. When as therefore the hireling, the idle drone, and the idoll ſhepheard haue the flocke of the ſheepe and lambes of Chriſt, and doe not feede them, or at the leaſt doe ſo feede them, that they are neuer the better: where is the faith which they boaſt of? is it any other then the dead faith and the faith of Diuels? Whoſoeuer therefore will haue the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of his faith in this calling, hee muſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the office as the Scripture bindeth him. Is it poſsible that he can giue credit to the word of God, and bee of a right beleefe, and not regarde this? The reſt of his good deedes, whereby ſome man will ſay he doth ſhew his faith, are no good deedes: for if hee did them of loue towards God and his brethren, would hee not then doe that, wherein his loue to both ſhould moſt of all ſhew it ſelfe? Can he loue God, and hate God? Can he loue men, and hate men? Or can hee loue God, and not regarde to doe his will? Or can hee loue men, and not care for the ſaluation of their ſoules? O my brethren, who cannot ſay to ſuch a man, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes?</hi> Who will bee ſo blind as to thinke ſuch are in good caſe?</p>
            <p>I will now draw towards an ende, onely by

And deare brethren, what ſhould make vs ſo ſlack, conſidering how ſhort our time is, and how great reaſons there are to perſwade vs: as firſt to begin with that, which is taught in this place: Is it not a marueilous bleſsing to haue the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our faith? Is it not a miſerable curſe, to be without the true peace of conſcience, and to abide ſtill in doubt? Doeth not God promiſe vs alſo, although wee can deſerue nothing, but when we haue done all that we can, wee are ſtill vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſeruants, that all our good workes ſhall be rewarded,

Make ye bagges which neuer waxe olde, or treaſure which neuer faileth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp;c. Shall not the promiſe of rewarde mooue vs? Goe further, how deare and precious ought the name of our God to bee vnto vs? how much ought it to delight vs to heare it magnified? how much ought wee to abhorre to ſee it ſtained and diſhonoured? Is not his name honoured, when thoſe which call vpon him, are fruitfull in good workes?

O wretches, ſhall not theſe things mooue vs to let the world ſee our faith and loue towards God, by our good works? Likewiſe, is there any greater loue which can bee ſhewed towards men, then when they ſhall be mooued by our good deeds, to glorifie God in the day of their viſitation, when our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealing ſhall cauſe them to confeſſe that it is an holie religion which wee profeſſe, and ſo giue eare and ioyne themſelues vnto the ſame?

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His portion of holie Scripture, beloued in the Lord, containeth in it two things. The one of them is a precept againſt rigorous iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our brethren: the other is for the ordering and guiding of the tongue in generall. Men offend generally and commonly in them both, and the offences therein committed bee not light, but very heinous in the ſight of God. As touching the former, how hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous it is it appeareth in this, that he ſaith, <hi>knowing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21168:112"/>that wee ſhall receiue the greater condemnation.</hi> The hainouſneſſe of the offences committed in the other is manifeſt by the verie ſpeeches of the Apoſtle, by which he ſetteth foorth the poiſon of the tongue. And in the firſt chapter of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, verſ. 26. he ſaith, <hi>If anie man among you ſeeme to bee religious and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiueth his owne heart, that mans religion is vaine.</hi> Heerby then it is euident that the matters be of great importance, and ſuch as it ſtandeth vs neerly vpon to be well inſtructed in: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you let vs hearken attentiuely to the voice of our God, and make conſcience to obey the ſame: for that is requiſite alſo vnleſſe we will deceiue our ſelues, as hee ſpeaketh in the firſt chapter, touching ſuch as be hearers of the word onlie, and not doers. And doubtleſſe hee that ſhall looke vpon the profeſſion of the Goſpel, which is at this day among men, and withall conſider how common the vices of the tongue be, and what the Lord here pronounceth againſt them, it will euen abaſh and aſtoniſh him, for he ſhall be euen forced to thinke that there is ſcarce any true religion to be found among men, ſeeing there be ſo few which are not rigorous Iudges; and ſcarce any that doe bridle their tongue.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to the words of the Text. <hi>Bee not many maſters, my brethren, knowing we ſhall receiue the greater condemnation: for in many thinges wee ſinne all.</hi> Heere bee three braunches in this: the firſt is the precept, <hi>Be not manie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21168:113"/>my brethren.</hi> The ſecond is a threatening of terrible vengeance, if we do not eſchewe that vice, which is in theſe words, <hi>Knowing that wee ſhall receiue the greater condemnation.</hi> The third, rendreth a reaſon both whie men ſhould not be rigorous and ſeucre in iudging their brethren, and alſo that if they be, their iudgment ſhall bee the heauier before God, in theſe wordes, <hi>For in many thinges we ſin all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the firſt branch, which is the precept, <hi>Be not many maſters.</hi> Saint lames ſpeaketh ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what darklie in this, becauſe Maſter, or maſters, is a word of office in the Scriptures. Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo, and rightlie, for he is the great maſter. <hi>Ye call me,</hi> ſaith he to his Apoſtles, Ioh 13. verſ. 13. <hi>Ho didaskalos, maſter and Lord, and ye ſay right, I am ſo:</hi> And Saint Paule ſaith, that Chriſt hath ſome Apoſtles, ſome prophets, ſome Euangeliſts, ſome paſtors and <hi>Didaskalous,</hi> that is Doctors, teachers, or as we tranſlate it heer in Saint Iames, <hi>Maſters.</hi> The word doth cauſe ſome to take it that he meaneth heere the publike office of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and eſpeciallie becauſe he ſaith, <hi>be not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maſters:</hi> for in that he ſaith, <hi>be not many,</hi> it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that he alloweth the Maſterſhip which hee heere ſpeaketh of, in ſome few: otherwiſe, whie doth he not ſay (if he ſpeake of a thing, which is ſimplie a vice in it ſelfe) My brethren, let no man be a maſter? And ſo they take it, that he reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that great vice, when men are ſo ready to thruſt themſelues into the Miniſterie, which they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21168:113"/>ſhould not doe ſo raſhlie, being indeed vnfit. This carieth a colour in it to lead vs to take the precept of the Apoſtle heere, as that hee willeth vs that manie ſhould not enter into the publike office of Doctors, ſeeing God giueth gifts but to a few, to be able to diſcharge it well. But indeede hee doth not heere deale with that publike maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but with a vice wherein each man taketh vpon him to be a ſeuere cenſurer, a iudge and a condemner of others, for in this men take vpon them to be maſters. If it ſhall be obiected, that then the holie Apoſtle might more plainlie haue ſaid, Let no man be a maſter, ſeeing no man may be a ſeuere and rigorous condemner of others: I anſwere, that hee applyeth his ſpeech according to the ſin which he reproueth for almoſt all take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be maſters, &amp; imperiouſlie to iudge and controwle all others. As in the diſeaſes of the bodie, if a man haue an infirmitie, hee ſhall find manie Phyſitions: for almoſt all men and women will haue ſome one medicine or other to preſcribe, and not knowing the complexion or conſtitution of the bodie or from what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cauſe the diſeaſe groweth, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they hit right, yet often they miſſe, and ſo hurt. If one ſhould ſpeake and ſay, let there not be many Phyſitions, it muſt bee taken againſt all ſuch vnskilfull miniſtring of Phyſicke. And ſo heere when he ſaith, <hi>Be not manie maſters,</hi> hee both noteth the vice to be common, reprooueth it that there be many ſeuere and rigorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demners
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:21168:114"/>of their brethren. As if hee ſhould ſay, Let not this fault remaine, that there bee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie maſters: not (by ſaying, <hi>many</hi>) allowing it in any one, for it is the fault which our Sauiour forbiddeth, Matth. 7. verſ. 1.2. Men are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giuen to be ſharp ſighted and curious about other mens faultes: yea they will pronounce very hardlie and rigorouſlie of them. Moreouer they doe not only iudge ſmall faults to be hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in others: but alſo depraue and take in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill part that often times, which is well done, or which may be well conſtrued: eſpecially where there is entred an opinion or conceit of great knowledge aboue others. As wee ſee it is almoſt the whole religion of many to depraue and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpie faultes euen in the beſt men, and therein they glorie much, and ſeeme therby to be great maſters excelling al others. For ſuch as do ſharply finde faultes, do highlie pleaſe themſelues as men in a more perfect eſtate. Of theſe it is written, Prou. 30. verſ. 12. <hi>There is a generation which is clean in their owne eies, which are not waſhed from their filthineſſe.</hi> Theſe are become ſo great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that they diſdaine to be taught by anie: they bee maſters, they be diſciples no longer. If a man do not pleaſe them, and as it were euen fit their humour in euerie ſmall quillitie, all that he doth, be he neuer ſo excellent, is with them nothing worth. Againſt this vncharitable and vnbrother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeueritie, the threatening is added, <hi>Knowing that wee ſhall receiue the greater damnation.</hi> This
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21168:114"/>ſheweth how highlie God is diſpleaſed with that kinde of men, againſt whome there is ſo heauy iudgement threatened. It is to this purpoſe to terrifie men from ſo foule a ſinne, in which they doe pleaſe themſelues as in a ſpeciall vertue. For they goe oftentimes away with it, as it were a zeale of godlineſſe againſt ſinne. It teacheth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on the contrarie, how much it pleaſeth God, that we iudge of the frailties of our brethren with charitie, with pitie and compaſſion, and with that ſpirit of meeknes which the Apoſtle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Galath. 6. ver. 1. The reaſon of both theſe doth appeare in the wordes following in the third branch, <hi>For in many thinges wee ſin all.</hi> For firſt it followeth vpon their owne iudgement which they giue ſo rigorouſlie againſt their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the iudgement of God is iuſt againſt them, hauing the ſame faults or as great, yea often times greater, as our Sauiour ſetteth it forth, <hi>How ſeeſt thou a mote in thy brothers eie, and beholdeſt not the beame that is in thine own ete?</hi> Mat. 7. This being the ſtate of rigorous carpers at the faults of others, that ſmall things amiſſe they eſpie in their brethren, and condemne the ſame with rigour, when as they haue in themſelues foule offences, which they ſpare, they couer and they mittigate with excuſes: ſhall not the iudgement of God be iuſt and ſeuere againſt them? About this matter S. Paul reaſoneth thus, <hi>Thou art therfore inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable O man, whoſoeuer thou art, that iudgeſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for in that thou iudgeſt another, thou condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21168:115"/>thy ſelfe, for thou doeſt the ſame things which condemneſt others. Now we knowe that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is according to trueth againſt thoſe which doe ſuch thinges. Doeſt thou thinke this, O man, which iudgeſt thoſe which doe ſuch thinges, and doeſt them, that thou ſhalt eſcape the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God?</hi> Rom. 2.1.2.3. We might reaſon thus, If I a ſinfull and corrupt man do condemne others as euill men not worthie to bee ſpared, for ſuch and ſuch ſinnes which they commit, then how ſhall I eſcape the iudgment of the moſt iuſt and righteous God, ſeeing I am alſo guiltie? Wee ſhall ſomtimes heare ſome that profeſſe the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſweare ſome ſmall oth, a fault indeed to be condemned, and a fault ouer common: for the holie ſeripture is plaine, <hi>Sweare not at all.</hi> Nowe ſome that refraine ſwearing, will bee ſo rigorous, and vncharitable and ſo ſeuere in iudging the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for this, as to be void of all religion and feare of God, when as in the meane time they do not ſee a vaineglorie, a ſelfe-loue, a bitter wrath and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which in themſelues, if it be mooued, is as hot as fire, with ſundry other foule ſinnes. If motes (as our Sauiour calleth the ſmaller frailties &amp; faultes in men) be iudged by vs ſo ſeuerely: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how ſhal ſuch foule and lothſome ſins in the iudgers eſcape the ſentence of God? now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as this proueth that he which is a rigorous iudge againſt his brother, cannot eſcape the ſeuerity of gods iudgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is alſo guiltie in the things for which hee conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth another, ſo may it alſo mitigate our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21168:115"/>it may moue vs vnto a moderation in our ſentence which we are ſo ready to giue of others, when we ſee them ſlip. For thus it ſhuld be in our mind: beholding my ſelfe I ſee that I ſin in many things, I am full of imperfections, I would haue the Lord to ſhew mercie and pitie towards me: I would not haue men rigorouſlie to iudge of me, but with charitie and compaſſion. And ſhall I not then when I ſee my brethren in the ſame caſe be fauourable towardes them? would I find mercie at the handes of God? or would I haue men charitable towardes mee? And yet without mercie, charitie, or compaſſion I iudge them rigorouſlie, being but in the ſame eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that I my ſelfe am in? Iudge in your ſelues brethren, is it not equall, when as in many things we ſinne all, that if we would haue mercie and compaſſion ſhewed towards vs, that we ſhould then lay aſide rigour and ſhew mercie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towardes our brethren which are weake and fraile, and ſubiect vnto manifold temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons euen as we be. What a peruerſneſſe is this, that I ſhould thinke my ſelfe worthie to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not others? I would haue all men deale charitablie towardes me, and I again to ſhew no charitie. I may touch others at my pleaſure: but if any touch me, it may not bee endured. As looke vpon theſe great maſters which S. Iames doth ſpeak of, that carpe daylie at the faults of others, and you ſhall ſee that when they haue whipped other men with the ſcourge of the tongue, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:21168:116"/>pierced them through as with a ſword, if any doe but touch them but euen as it were with the prick of a pin, how they ſtartle &amp; how they cal for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: they feel not that which they doe vnto their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make ſmal faults to be haynous offences, yea when they peruerſly depraue that which is wel done, it is very light: but if any ſpeak a word againſt ſome fault of theirs, the caſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it is ſore iniurie; if it be a fault, yet they ought to deale charitablie. Heerby it doth appeare what an high price men do ſet themſelues at, and how baſely they doe eſteeme of all others. Other men (becauſe of their ſins) be ſtark naught, not to bee regarded nor pitied: wee hauing the ſame ſins, or as great are ſtill very precious. Thus may we ſee how far men are a wry fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which they ought to be. The Lord calleth vs from it, and it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if we wil be wiſe, to ſeek to be cured of ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a diſeaſe. A right precious &amp; an acceptable thing it is to God, when we can ſo conſider and iudge of our ſelues amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g others, as that we value our ſelues with them as poore ſinners to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo become pitifull alſo &amp; ful of mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. For that is it which the Lord ſaith by the prophet. <hi>I wil haue mercy &amp; not ſacrifice.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee. 6.7 But here we muſt beware that it be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and mercie which wee ſhewe towardes our brethren, and not an irreligious cloking of ſinne, or ſoothing men vp in euil. For manie vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this, that wee are commaunded not to iudge, will haue no faults to bee reprooued, but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21168:116"/>euerie man haue to doe onlie with himſelfe, and let others alone. This is a bad collection, this is contrarie to the doctrine of the holie Scriptures, which willeth vs to admoniſh one another. Mat. 18. verſ. 15. It is contrarie to the rule of charity as it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but thou ſhalt plainlie rebuke thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſuffer him not to ſinne,</hi> Leuit. 19. verſ. 17. And our Sauiour Chriſt when he ſaith, <hi>Iudge not,</hi> doeth not will vs that we ſhould not admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and reprooue our brethren for their faultes. ſo wee doe it rightlie. For hee doeth not ſay. What haſt thou to doe with the moate that is in thy brothers eie, or why medleſt thou with the faultes of others? but caſt firſt the beame out of thine owne eie, and then maiſt thou ſee cleerely to caſt the moat out of thy brothers eie. Heere is the matter, if we will be right reformers, we muſt firſt beginne with our ſelues. For ſhall we be fit to teach others that teach not our ſelues? What good minde can it come from? Can a man be rightlie carefull that another ſhould bee godlie and ſaued, and not care for godlineſſe and ſaluation in himſelfe? Can hee pitie the ſoules of other men, which pitieth not his own? Againe, what a rebuking is that, when hee is ſo ſeuere and rigorous againſt others ſmall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and ſpareth his owne great ſinnes? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee may perceiue a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that Chriſtian and charitable admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing &amp; rebuking which the Scripture comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21168:117"/>and that rigorous iudging which it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. For touching the one, hee that is trulie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed feeling the grace, the mercie and the loue of God, he is moued with mercie and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards others, and wiſheth their reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their good. This cauſeth him to looke into the faultes of his neighbour whom he loueth and wiſheth well vnto: and when he doth amiſſe, he telleth him friendlie of it. Who can ſay that ſuch a reproouing is to be miſliked? Nay, we are all of vs to thank God highlie when hee giueth vs ſuch a friend as will ſo put vs in mind of our dutie: for wee can ſee other mens faults, and other men can eſpie our offences more cleerely than wee our ſelues. In worldlie matters men are verie willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie found fault withall: and taught wherein they haue erred, ſo they ſee that there come profit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them or gaine thereby And ſhall we not be as willing to haue that tolde vs, which may benefit our ſoules? But now for thoſe maſters which S. Iames ſpeaketh of, their doing is nothing like. They are not reformed themſelues, they find not fault of loue. They doe eſpie faults, they iudge ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely of them, they carp, they obiect: but not of pitie or compaſſion, not reſpecting the good of thoſe whome they ſo iudge: but to diffame, to diſcredite, and to bring into contempt. Is it not (thinke you) a verie ſtraunge thing, that theſe men voide of charitie, and full of great ſins, ſhould beare themſelues in hand of a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eſtate then is in others, and take vpon them
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:21168:117"/>a maſterſhip, ſo ſeuerely to iudge, euen becauſe they can eſpie faultes? Maruell not, beloued, that the ſcripture doth ſo thunder againſt this kind of people: for their doing is abominable. True it is, that a wiſe man, when any of theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſpreadeth reports of his faults (if anie frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or imperfections doe breake from him) or when they vpbraid him with the ſame to his face, is to make his profite thereby, and not ſo much to conſider with what mind they doe it, as how true it is, and to amend it. For I ſay if we be wiſe, we may make great vſe of the harde ſpeeches of vncharitable reproouers: for by them oftentimes we hear of ſome imperfections which our friends are blind in, or at the leaſt are ouer fauorable and will not deale plainelie with vs. Yea and it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs alſo to bee ſomewhat the more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and warie in our doinges, when ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere iudges doe obſerue vs narrowly. Thus much touching the firſt part of this ſcripture.</p>
            <p>The ſecond nowe followeth, which is for the ordering and guiding of the tongue. And this hath two partes: the former part ſetteth foorth how the ordering of the tongue well carieth ſuch a force with it, though it bee but a little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that all is well ordered when it is right. And to ſet foorth this there bee two ſimilitudes vſed, which are of ſmall thinges that yet direct and order great thinges. As the bitte of a bridle is but a ſmall thing, and the rudder of a ſhip. The ſecond part declareth the woonderfull and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21168:118"/>power that the tongue hath, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not wel ordered, vnto all miſchief. Where alſo, leaſt it might ſeem ſtrange that ſo infinit euil ſhuld pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſo ſmall a thing, he vſeth a ſimilitude from a ſpark of fire, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which a great matter is ſet on flame. Further hee ſheweth by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of the nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt wild &amp; cruel things, what an horrible vnrulie euill the tongue is, doing that which is monſtrous &amp; as it were againſt al courſe of nature. But I wil come to the words as they lie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If anie man ſin not in word, be is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole bodie.</hi> In this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is, as they ſay, hypotheticall, hee ſheweth that he which is able to rule and doth rule, his tongue ſo that he doth not offend with it, he is perfect, and doth bridle and order well the whole bodie. For where that little member goeth right al goeth right. But doth not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle put a caſe here which neuer falleth out? Is there anie man perfect, which ſinneth not? It is out of doubt, that if Saint Iames doe meane by a perfect man, ſuch an one as hath no ſinne in him, that then hee putteth a caſe that is neuer founde: &amp; if we take him ſo, yet his matter ſtandeth ſure. For doubtles if there could bee a man abſolutelie perfect in his toong, he ſhuld be perfect through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Or if we take him as the ſcripture doth vſe to ſpeake, calling them perfect which are come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſound ſtrength of godlines, and ripe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as 1. Cor. 2.6. <hi>We ſpeake wiſdome,</hi> ſaith S. Paule, <hi>among thoſe which are perfect.</hi> And
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21168:118"/>Phil. 3.15. <hi>As many as are perfect, let vs thinke his.</hi> And Heb. 6. verſ. 1. <hi>Let vs be caried on vnto perfection.</hi> If I ſay we take perfection ſo, then look how far a man is growne in all godlines, ſo farre is it in his tongue, and looke what wanteth in his tongue of ſuch perfection, that he wanteth in all other partes: for the perfection or the want in the whole man goeth with the want and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the tongue. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſheweth the cauſe, ſaying. <hi>Out of the aboundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh: A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth foorth good thinges: and an euill man out of the euill treaſure bringeth forth euill things.</hi> Matt. 12.34.35. The tongue is the ſpeciall inſtrument to vtter euerie thing which is in the heart. Look how far the hart is ſound and good, ſo far wil the tongue be good. For let the heart proceede vnto neuer ſo great perfection, the tongue will vtter it, and be good according to the goodnes of the heart. And look what euill is in the tongue, it commeth from the heart. And when wicked thoughts be in the hart, the tongue cannot ſo diſſemble, but at one time or another they will break foorth in ſpeech: As come to particulars, If the heart be full of light, of knowledge and true wiſdome, the tongue will vtter it. If there be darknes, ignorance &amp; error, the ſpeech will bee according. If there bee faith, the toong wil confeſſe it: if the loue of God, there wil breake foorth praiſe and thankſgiuing. If meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the wordes will bee gentle. If pride and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21168:119"/>wrath, the tongue is fierce and bitter. If chaſtitie, then pure ſpeech and from vnclean luſts, a foule mouth. What ſhould I rehearſe particulars? the tongue is as the heart is in all thinges: a vaine tongue argueth a vaine heart. Let no man ſtand vpon this and ſay, words are but winde, it is no great matter what a mans wordes bee, there is no harme done, it is but communication. This is an ignorant ſpeech, for the wordes are of ſuch waight, that our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Of euerie idle word you ſhall gine a reckoning at the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By thy wordes thou ſhalt be iuſtified, and by thy wordes thou ſhalt bee condemned.</hi> Matt. 12. verſ. 36.37, Shall a man then ſay further, though my wordes be but vaine and fooliſh, yet I mean no hurt, my heart is good? Alas what an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is that? Is not the tongue the opener of that which lay hid in the heart? Euen as a man beholdeth his face in a glaſſe, ſo may wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the heart of a man in his tongue. True it is that the hypocrite which hath a wicked heart, can ſpeake good wordes: but yet the wickednes will breake foorth at times doe what he can. But ſhall ſuch a little member extend ſo farre as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here ſpeaketh? Shall hee that doeth bridle it bridle all partes of the bodie? No maruel, as hee declareth by his two ſimilitudes. Horſes that be ſtrong, fierce and full of courage, are yet with a little bit in their mouthturned about by the rider. A ſhip is a great thing, and often driuen of fierce winds vpon the ſeas: and yet the gouernour with
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21168:119"/>the little rudder turneth them about which way he wil. As ſuch little thinges turne about great and mightie things: ſo the tongue though it bee but a little member, yet hee ſaith boaſteth great thinges. This ſeemeth a very hard application. For he ſpeaketh heere before of the well ordering of the tongue what power it hath, and now ſaith boaſteth great thinges; for boaſting is not good, and a man may boaſt great thinges which yet he cannot do. The bit in the horſe mouth doth turn him about indeed, and ſo doth the little rudder more then boaſt of turning about the great ſhip. Why then ſaith hee the tongue boaſteth great thinges? Indeed the word may well bee ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated: But S. Iames doth vſe it not as a bare boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, nor in euill part: but as if he ſhould ſay, look how the bit is a little thing and turneth about the whole bodie of a fierce horſe, cauſing him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the rider; and as the rudder is ſmall and yet turneth about a great ſhip, or as theſe two little things do great matters: ſo the tongue being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall member lifteth it ſelfe vp to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of verie great things. It ſo boaſteth, that it performeth them indeede. But what bee thoſe great matters which it doth ſo well? To ſpeake brieflie, it bringeth forth all the good treaſures of the hart, as our Sauiour hath ſaid. Look what gift of grace or heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly thing the holy ghoſt worketh in the heart of man, his tongue vttereth the ſame. The tongue is giuen as a ſpeciall inſtrument to glorifie &amp; praiſe god. Great duties it is to perform
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21168:120"/>that way, and as it were to leade the whole bodie. And alſo towards men it doeth many goodly things: Out of a wiſe heart, it bringeth forth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; knowledge to inform and to iuſtruct the ignorant. It giueth wholeſome aduiſe, and good counſel vnto ſuch as need. It perſwadeth &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth, exhorteth, admoniſheth and rebuketh as need doth require. Yea infinite are the benefites which the tongue rightlie ordered doth bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men. <hi>Let no corrupt communication</hi> (ſaith Saint Paule) <hi>proceed out of your mouthes: but ſuch as is good to the vſe of edifying, that it may miniſter grace to the hearers.</hi> Epheſ. 4.29. And alſo hee ſaith, <hi>Let your ſpeech be alwayes gracious and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with ſalt, that ye may know how to anſwer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man,</hi> Coloſſ. 4.6. Beloved when wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well of theſe thinges, it teacheth vs how farre off we be from perfection. For doe wee not come woonderfull farre ſhort of guiding our tongue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of theſe great things, both in glorifying God, &amp; alſo in miniſtring grace by our talk at al times vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What ſhall ſpeak of our wants in this point? If we did wel &amp; throughly behold &amp; diſcern the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this one thing wold mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto vs, that in manie things we ſin al: that ſo we might not be ſo rigorous in condemning or iudging others. For if we come ſo far ſhort in the duties of the tongue, both in praiſing God, and alſo in benefiting men ſo manie wayes as wee might and are bounde: What ſhall wee thinke is the number of all our ſinnes?
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21168:120"/>wee may well ſay, that they be moe in number then the haires of our head. But why hath the Lord ſet foorth this power and good of the right ordered tongue? wee muſt well conſider of that. It is not that wee ſhould come to the ſight onely how vnperfect we are, but that withal we ſhould labour and ſtriue towards greater perfection. It is a moſt worthy thing to profeſſe the holy faith, and to ſound foorth the praiſe and glorie of the moſt high God. Alſo it is an excellent thing to ſpeake ſuch wordes as may at all times miniſter grace to the hearers. Hereunto appertaineth that which Salomon ſaieth, The tongue of the iuſt man is as fined ſiluer, and the lippes of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous doe feed many. Prouerb. 10.20, 21.</p>
            <p>Thus much concerning the firſt part, which is the ordering of the tongue aright; which is an exceeding great matter: and now I will proceed to the other part, that is the wonderfull harme of the euill tongue: for looke how great the power of the tongue is vnto good, where it is well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo great force hath it alſo on the other part vnto all miſchiefe, where it is not bridled. And leaſt this might ſeeme ſtrange or incredible, the Apoſtle vſeth a compariſon: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>how great a thing a little fire kindleth.</hi> Wee all know, that one little ſparke of fire lighting into drie matter, is enough to fire a whole houſe, and ſo a whole citie, a countrey, yea the whole world, ſo much as will kindle and burne. This is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing which God hath giuen to the fire,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21168:121"/>that from ſo little ſo great flames will ariſe, and that it will ſpread in ſuch ſort. And Saint Iames ſaith, that the tongue is fire. It is not of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fire: it is figuratiuely called fire: for it will ſpread farre, though it be little, and ſet all on a flame euen as fire: yea it extendeth it ſelfe in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe ſo farre, that hee calleth it a world of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. What a marueilous ſaying is this? Is the tongue ſo ſmall a member, and yet containeth in it ſuch a depth and ſuch a gulfe of all wickednes? A world is a great thing, it is the vniuerſalitie of all creatures, and by this the holy Apoſtle doeth expreſſe the wickedneſſe of the tongue: as if he ſhould ſay, the generalitie of all euill and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe is the tongue. What euill, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, what wickedneſſe, what treacheries and lies come not from the tongue? And marke how hee ſaith, that the tongue is ſo placed or ſet among our members, that it defileth the whole bodie. If a thing bee full of euill, and ſet with ſuch diſtance that it can not touch another thing, then the euill is not ſpread but reſteth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth it ſelfe: but it is not ſo yee ſee with the tongue: for it is ſo ſet that it defileth the whole bodie. And ſo fire, where the drie matter is abſent doth nothing; but if it light vpon it, then it enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all, and ſetteth the whole on fire: Euen ſo he ſaith, that the tongue reacheth vnto and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on fire the courſe of nature. The whole courſe of nature may verie well be taken for the whole world, as if he ſhould ſay, The tongue euen like
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21168:121"/>a firebrand ſetteth the whole world on fire: for the truth is, that in all places there be hote flames of contention, there be broiles and diſſentions: yea all things doe boile and burne with the fire of the tongue. And in the next wordes he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what manner of fire the tongue is, and from whence it hath that fire. It is (ſaith hee) it ſelfe ſet on fire of hell. Then is the tongue not onely fire, but moſt peſtilent and helliſh or deuiliſh fire. Hell enflameth the tongue: how can that be? Hell is here put for the deuils of hell: they ſet the tongue on fire, they doe enflame it with the helliſh fire: for as the holy ghoſt inſpiring and ſanctifying the heart of a good or godly man, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it with all precious and heauenly treaſures, which then the tongue bringeth foorth to the praiſe and glorie of God, and to the benefite of men: ſo the deuill filleth the hearts of wicked men with ſuch treaſures as hell doth affoord, and their tongues doe vtter foorth the ſame. And in that reſpect the holy Apoſtle ſaith, that the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue it ſelfe is ſet on fire of hell. O that men would conſider of this, how their tongues are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall inſtruments of the deuill, to ſpread here in the whole worlde the fire of hell. O that they would weigh and conſider whome they ſerue, and whoſe worke they doe perfourme. That tongue which hath beene giuen to be the chiefe inſtrument in the bodie of man for to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the praiſe and honour of the Lorde, and to benefit men: how is it turned and changed to be
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21168:122"/>the firebrand to ſet the whole world on fire, euen with the fire of hell? But if it be demanded, what is this ſame fire which it is enflamed withall, and with which it doth enflame the whole courſe of nature? You know that Saint Paul ſaith, The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill hath fiery dartes, which faith doth quench: now where faith is not, hee fixeth thoſe dartes in the heart of man, and ſo when the heart is filled with that helliſh fire, the tongue preſently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it, and caſteth it abroad euen like wild fire: hee ſhooteth the dart of pride and vaineglorie &amp; ambition into the mind, the dart of ſelfeloue, of enuie, of hatred, and of malice. Moreouer, he faſteneth his dartes of vanitie and vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, with the dartes of all vncleane luſts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and adulterie. Theſe are from hell, theſe are fierie, and the fire of Gods wrath is with them: and the tongue hereupon ſcattereth and diſperſeth all this fire abroad; as, wordes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, of diſdaine and reproch, words full of fury and bitter rage, with lying, and ſlandring, &amp; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, wordes full of vanitie and horrible othes, wordes full of filthie ribaldrie and all manner of beaſtly ſongs. Shall I take vpon me to number the ſtarres, or to meaſure the ſandes of the ſea? If not, what ſhould I take vpon me to enter into all particulars in this matter? There is nothing which the fiends of hell doe ſuggeſt into the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heartes of men, but the tongue poureth it forth. Hereupon (as wee ſee by daily experience) all the world is on a flame, euen with the fire of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:21168:122"/>hell. There is curſing, and banning, and raging: there is boaſting, and quarrelling, and reuiling: there is falſe accuſing, lying, and condemning: yea, (as the Apoſtle ſaide before) there is in the ſpeech euen a world of wickednes: all the partes of man are defiled by the ſame. It is a generall contagion that ouerſpreadeth the whole. And Saint Iames doeth yet further ſet foorth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſſe of the tongue by a compariſon. There is a wonderfull fierce nature in ſundrie ſortes of wilde beaſts, as in the lyon, the leopard, the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre, and the wolfe, with many others; &amp; of theſe, men haue caught ſome, and brought them to be tame. There bee alſo among the foules, among the creeping things, and among the fiſhes, things verie wilde and vnruly, which yet by man haue beene tamed: but (ſaith hee) the tongue can no man tame. All the cruell nature of the ſauadge wilde beaſts, of foules, of ſerpents, and of fiſhes, is not like the tongue, that paſſeth them all; no wiſedome nor power of man can tame that. Is not this a wonderfull thing? will men beleeue that this little member ſhould haue ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it, that no man can rule it? Maruaile not at this, the cauſe is euident, euen by that which goeth before in this text. Is there any beaſt, any foule, any ſerpent, or fiſh, whoſe nature is to be compared to the deuill, or to the fire of hell? I doubt not but euery man will confeſſe and ſay thus, There bee horrible and ſauage natures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong beaſtes, and ſerpentes, and dragons, but
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:21168:123"/>the deuils goe beyond them all, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, hell can not bee matched, that fire can not bee quenched, there is no taming of thoſe things. Then marke how he ſaid, that the tongue is ſet on fire of hell. The nature of hell, the nature of the deuill is put into the tongue: and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it commeth to paſſe that it is harder to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then all the nature of ſerpents and wilde beaſts. Then when hee ſaith, But the tongue can no man tame, is it his meaning that there is nor was neuer any man, but his tongue hath beene vntamed, ſet on fire of hell, and ſo a firebrand to ſet the worlde on fire? The tongues of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the tongues of the Apoſtles, the tongues of the martyrs and holy men haue vttered the heauenly trueth to the praiſe of God, and to the ſingular good of men: how then is it ſaide, The tongue can no man tame? were not the tongues of theſe wel tamed? yes verely: but yet this ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtill, The tongue can no man tame. For their tongues were tamed not by themſelues, nor by any wiſedome, power, or vertue of man: but by grace, euen by the working and power of the heauenly ſpirit of God from aboue. No man then, but the Lorde God, whoſe power is aboue all, hath euer tamed the nature of the tongue. There is nothing in man from Satan or from hel, be it neuer ſo peſtilent &amp; horrible, but the grace &amp; power of God can ſubdue it. It is not then the purpoſe or meaning of the Apoſtle, by ſaying, but the tongue can no man tame, to lead men vnto
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:21168:123"/>this, euen to let it alone, for that which is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible vnto man, he will not ſet vpon it, at leaſt, if he know ſo much. For to what end and purpoſe ſhould a man goe about to doe that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his power? I ſay it is not the purpoſe of the holy Apoſtle ſo to perſwade, but by ſhewing the difficultie and impoſſibilitie in regard of mans ſtrength, hee mooueth men to ſeeke vnto God for the power of his grace, for there is all the helpe. And ſeeing there is helpe in God, how can we be excuſed, if we doe not flie vnto him? The thing is moſt horrible, wee ought to abhorre it that wee ſhould carrie in our mouth the fire of hell and the nature of the deuill. Shall wee not thirſt for thoſe heauenly and pure waters of the holy ghoſt, which ſhall extinguiſh ſuch helliſh fire? O beloued, it is the mind and purpoſe of the Apoſtle when he ſheweth vs theſe things, to ſtir vs vp to ſeeke more earneſtly vnto God, and not to truſt to our owne ſtrength: vnleſſe wee make ſmall account to carrie ſuch a tongue, yea ſuch a firebrande of hell in our mouth, as is worſe then any ſerpent. What a loathſome thing ought it to be to the minde of euery man to haue his mouth full of the fire of hell euer and anon for to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad? wee holde it a verie rare and moſt ſtrange and monſtrous thing, if any beaſt ſhould carrie ranke poiſon in his mouth to caſt forth farre and neere: and the tongue of man ſpreadeth that which is a great deale woorſe then any poiſon: for men ſpitte fire, euen the verie fire of hell.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:21168:124"/>alas, ſhall wee not ſeeke helpe for this? O belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, be not deceiued to thinke that the ſpeeches of the Apoſtle are more vehement then the matter requireth. I confeſſe that the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vſeth ſometimes hyperbolicall ſpeeches, but in theſe compariſons it is not ſo. The tongue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is (as he ſaith) an vnruly euill, full of deadly poiſon. You know what is written in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Their mouth is full of curſing and bitternes, the poiſon of Aſpes is vnder their lippes, their throate is an open ſepulchre, they flatter vvith their tongues.</hi> Wee can not away with the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Aſpes, wee loath to heare of it: and ſhall wee not then loath to carrie ſuch horrible deadly poiſon in our tongues? Let vs thinke well of theſe things, and iudge of them, as the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, and not according to our owne ſenſe: for as euery thing liketh and loueth that which is in their owne nature, (as the toad liketh her owne poiſon, ſo doeth the venemous ſerpent, the Aſpe, and the Cockatrice:) ſo ſhall men by nature like and loue well the poiſon which is vnder their tongue, and that fire with which it is enflamed by hell. Men doe indeede euen glorie in thoſe horrible things which come from their tongue. Let vs therfore, as I ſaid, iudge of the things as the Lord pronounceth, &amp; not according to our own ſenſe. The Lord ſaith, that the tongues of men are full of deadly poiſon. If wee were throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereof, would it not euen force vs to ſeek vnto the Lord to haue ſuch poiſon remoued?
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:21168:124"/>Would we like well to continue ſtil as venemous ſerpents? Could wee thinke well of this that the diuell ſhould fire our tongues with the fire of hell? Or that hee ſhould vſe our tongues as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſet all in a broile? God bee mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and helpe vs, for our caſe otherwiſe is moſt wretched and miſerable. And let vs now ſee what reaſon the Apoſtle rendreth, to ſhewe that the tongue is full of deadly poyſon: for he giueth an inſtance or a taſte of the ſame deadly poyſon in one particular, which is this: <hi>Therewith bleſſe we God euen the father, and therewith curſe wee men which are made after the image of God: Out of one mouth proceedeth bleſſing and curſing: my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren theſe things ought not ſo to be.</hi> If he ſhould ſtand to ſhewe the poyſon in euery particular, it were much: this one may leade vs to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many. To come then vnto it, thus it is: There is not almoſt any ſo wicked, but will haue words of praiſing God in their mouth, yea thoſe words are often ſo godly and ſmooth, that they ſeeme to be with deuotion, euen as if they carried a reuerence and a great regarde to the name of the moſt high God. But let any man diſpleaſe them, and by and by they curſe him: which ſheweth that their bleſsing &amp; praiſing of God is but in a vaine ſhew. For if they did indeede and aright loue and reuerence the maieſtie of God, then would they alſo regard his image in man: for man is made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the image of God. Can they bleſſe God and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21168:125"/>curſe his image? If wee bleſſe and praiſe the Lord in deede in all his workes, then chiefly in the workmanſhip of man, in whom hee hath ſet the print of his owne image. And if wee cannot in that worke beholde his glorie and praiſe him, how ſhall wee doe it in other things? If any ſhall obiect, that the image of GOD was broken downe in man through the fall of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: and that ſuch as bee renewed in Chriſt, and the image of GOD againe ſet vp in them, in thoſe we may behold the glorie of God, ſuch wee doe not curſe, but wee curſe men that bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and wicked. I anſwer that there is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſuch regard had, but the tongue doth curſe the good as well as the bad, and ſpareth none. And doubtles it is a greater and a more fowler thing to curſe a right godlie man, then to curſe a wicked man, becauſe in the godlie man, the image of GOD doth ſhine in beautie, and where his image doth more appeare, we are bound more to loue and to reuerence: but yet it is a fowle thing to curſe any man, and doth in ſome ſort reach vnto God. For albeit the image of God, touching righteouſnes and holines is broken downe wholie in them, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſome partes of his image, there is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding or reaſon, and ſuch thinges as by which a man doth greatlie differ from a beaſt. Sundrie excellent giftes there bee in man, which hee that vtterlie deſpiſeth, offereth iniurie to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:21168:125"/>the maieſtie of God: and that is the cauſe why Saint Iames bringeth it in as an abſurde thing, that the ſame tongue bleſſeth GOD, and curſeth men which are made after the image of GOD. But what ſhall wee ſaye of this curſing of men, is it rare? Surelie it is very common where wrath is kindled, and diſpleaſure ariſeth. The horrible curſes and execrations which come out of mens mouthes, would make a man that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth GOD, euen tremble to heare. There is no ſparing of any, but this deadly poyſon of the tongue is powred forth vpon all. The brother curſeth the brother, the Father the children, and the children againe their Father, the Husband the Wife, and the Wife her Husband. If a man would (as I may ſaye) defile his mouth, and the eares of thoſe that ſhoulde heare it, hee might vtter ſo many of their vſuall curſes and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as woulde make and fill a pretie booke. And let but two men fall out or two women, which haue not learned the true ſeare of GOD, doe but marke the bitter poyſon of the wordes which will come from them: What reuilings will each giue vnto the other? what wordes of diſdaine, contempt, and reproach? How baſe will each of them ſet forth the other for to bee? What is it almoſt that can bee deuiſed which is baſe, vile and loathſome, but the one will tearme the other by it? And with what vehemencie is it v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee done? There is no more regard of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21168:126"/>image and glorie of God in each of them, then there is of a dogge. What a poyſon is this? what a vile wickedneſſe proceedeth from the tongue? Saint Iames ſheweth that it doth as a monſtrous thing peruert the order and courſe of nature: when out of the ſame mouth there proceedeth bleſsing and curſing. <hi>Doth a fountaine</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſend foorth at one place ſweete water and bitter? Can the figge-tree, my brethren, bring foorth oliues, either a vine figges? ſo can no fountaine make both ſalt water and ſweete.</hi> If it be againſt the courſe of nature that ſuch things ſhould bee, then doth it follow that ſome part of the words which come from the mouth are as ſweete water, and other ſome of them bee bitter: nay they bee either all ſweete or all bitter. Now it is moſt euident that the one part, that is to ſay, the curſing of men, the contemptuous railings, reproches, and reuilings, is not ſweete, but euen as moſt bitter water. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon then it followeth, that the other part which ſeemed to bee very ſweete water, that is, their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and praiſing of God, is alſo very bitter. For as the holie Apoſtle hath ſhewed, they cannot bee both ſweete and bitter. If one be bitter, both are bitter. But how can their bleſsing of GOD bee bitter? how can that bee poyſon? Is not the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and praiſing of God, a moſt precious and a moſt excellent thing? Doth S. Iames ſet that with the deadly poyſon of the tongue? I anſwere, that the bleſsing, the praiſing and the honouring of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21168:126"/>God, is of all other things the moſt excellent and precious, when it is rightly done: but if it be done but in faſhion and ſhew, or in bare words, it is but a prophaning and an abuſing of the moſt holie and glorious name of God. Then is it hypocriſie, then is it ſinne, yea euen an abomination. There can no praiſe bee giuen to God ſo great, but it is true. But euery thing which in it ſelfe is true, is not rightly done. Wee reade in the Goſpell, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus would not ſuffer the diuels to confeſſe him. And the diuell in the maide that vttered this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touching Paul and his companions, Theſe be the ſeruants of the moſt high God, which ſhewe vnto vs the way of ſaluation, diſpleaſed Paul. Act. 16. So no doubt the praiſing or bleſsing of God with a wicked tongue, is not acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Marke then briefly how Saint Iames hath reaſoned to proue that God is not bleſſed nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored by a tongue which curſeth men. Firſt if they did ſincerely and from the heart bleſſe God in deede, how could they curſe the image of God in men? Secondly, it is vnpoſsible in the courſe of nature, that ſweete water and bitter ſhould come out of one fountaine, and ſo is it, that the true prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or bleſsing of God, and the curſing of men, ſhould come out of the ſame mouth. Let all then conſider well, how they honour and worſhippe GOD. For this is it wherewith men doe beare themſelues in hand that they bee religious, that they call vpon God, and that they aſcribe glorie
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21168:127"/>and praiſe vnto him. They neuer conſider with what manner of tongue they doe it. They curſe and banne, they rayle, reuile and reproach. They ſweare borriblie, they lie, they do ſlaunder and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame. They flatter, they boaſte, they ſcoffe, they ieſt, they power forth words of all vanitie. They ſpeake all manner of vncleane words, and out at their mouth commeth forth as it were the ſtinking mind of a moſt filthie puddle, or of a rotten dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill: And then with the ſame tongue ſo polluted, and in that vncleane veſſell of their mouth, they will bring and offer vp thoſe ſweete odors of the praiſe of God. Here is a great inſtruction mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto vs, which we ought carefullie to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto, and to print it in our minde. If euer we haue to doe with any man or woman, which is poore and baſe for outward reſpects, and take it that they offer vs wrong, ſo that our wrath begin to bee kindled, let vs take heed that neither our heart ſo farre deſpiſe them, nor our tongue vtter ſuch contemptuous ſpeeches vnto them, ſuch words of diſdaine and ignorminie, ſuch baſe and vile tearmes, as that we forget the image of God in them. O beloued ſhall not this a little bridle vs, ſhall we giue ſuch tearmes to the image of God, as we would ſcarce giue to a dog? If any ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and ſay, ſome are ſo wicked and abominable, that no ſpeech can be too baſe for them. I anſwer, according to the doctrine of the holy Apoſtle here, that howſoeuer wee are to loath and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21168:127"/>their wickednes, yea to giue them ſuch phraſes of ſpeech as may expreſſe their bad eſtate (as wee ſhall finde the holy Scripture doth) yet ſpare the image of God in them, euen ſo farre as it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: giue them not ſuch ſpeeches, that be ſo vile, as I am loath to name any of them, which ye ſhall vſually heare proceeding out of mens mouthes, when they doe fall out, leaſt therein you curſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile, and vtterlie deſpiſe the image of God. To conclude, let the feare of God bridle our tongues, that this deadly and diueliſh poyſon may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of them, and that with them wee maye magnifie and praiſe the Lord God, ſo that our praiſe may be acceptable vnto him, and that our ſpeeches may be ſuch as tend vnto edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that miniſter grace to the hearers. Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He holie Prophet, King Dauid was the compoſer and writer of this Pſalme, as the title thereof doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mention. It is called a ſong of degrees, as there be 14. other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, here ſet together of the ſame title, but in what ſence: the learned interpreters are of diuers iudgements. I will follow that which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable by the holie Scriptures. The word <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loth,</hi> which the Prophet here vſeth, doth properlie ſignifie ſteps or ſtaires, by which we aſcend into higher places. But by a Metaphor (as I take it to be here vſed) it ſignifieth high eſtate, high degree, excellencie, or dignitie. For proofe hereof wee reade, 1. Chro. 17. verſ. 17. where Dauid ſpeaking vnto God, ſaith, thou haſt regarded me according to the eſtate of a man of high degree, vſing the ſame word that is here. So then, if wee conſider
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:21168:128"/>the phraſe of the Hebrew tongue, which to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſie the ſuperlatiue degree, vſeth the plurall number, a ſong of degrees, that is, a ſong of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, or a ſong of dignities, is as much as to ſay, a moſt excellent, or a moſt worthy ſong. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt in giuing this title, doth, as it were, ſet a marke in the forehead of the Pſalme, to giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice vnto vs, that there is a treaſure of moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent doctrine, and moſt fit for our inſtruction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, that wee may with the greater dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and attention giue eare vnto it.</p>
            <p>The Argument or the matter here handled, is all but one. For the holy ghoſt with a very high and ſingular praiſe, through the whole Pſalme doth ſet forth and commend the vnitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of brethren. The brethren (which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of and which are to keepe this holy agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) are all the faithfull children of the Church, fellow members of Chriſts myſticall body, and true worſhippers of GOD, among whom is the ſpirituall brother-hoode. The vertue it ſelfe which is here commended, is that ſame which Saint Paul doth ſo earneſtly exhort and perſwade all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an men vnto, to keepe the vnity of the ſpirite, in the bond of peace, Epheſ. 4. verſ. 3. The Primitiue Church is commended for the practiſe thereof, in which wee haue a liuely example ſet before vs: for it is written, that the multitude of them that beleeued were of one heart, and of one ſoule, Act. 4. verſ. 32. For as one body conſiſting of many members, hath but one heart and one ſoule, by
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21168:129"/>which all the members are vnited, and loue each other, ſo the multitude were vnited in iudgement and affection, as if there were but one heart and one ſoule in them all.</p>
            <p>The commendation and praiſe by which the holie Ghoſt ſetteth foorth the excellent worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this vertue, is vnder two Epithites, which are theſe, good and comelie. For hee ſaith, behold how good and how comely a thing it is, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren alſo to dwell in vnitie. Theſe two Epithites hee afterward openeth and amplifieth by two ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes: the one is taken from the annoynting of Aaron with the precious oyntment, to declare chiefly the ſweete and pleaſant comelines of this vnitie: the other is taken from the dewe of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which commeth downe vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Sion, to expreſſe the fruite and good that commeth thereof. And finally, he concludeth from the higheſt cauſe, euen the Lord God, who hath commanded the bleſsing of life eternall to be vpon this vnitie. This is briefly the ſumme of the Pſalme, or of this praiſe which is giuen. Now come to the expoſition.</p>
            <p>By the firſt word (behold) the Prophet doeth ſtirre vp the mindes of the Iſraelites, euen of al the Tribes, to take view how bleſſed a thing vnitie and concorde is, euen by their owne experience which they had, partly by the former times, and partly by the time then preſent. For in former daies they had felt with much ſorrowe, the great calamities, harmes, and annoyances of diſcorde:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21168:129"/>and at this time now preſent when this Pſalme was giuen, they ſawe the bleſsings and benefits of vnitie and peace. For their former experience in the daies of King Saul, when he perſecuted Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid which had done none euill, the worſhippe of God was neglected, good men were oppreſſed, euill men flouriſhed, with much grieſe of minde vnto many, then was there diſcord, ſo farre as men durſt ſpeake.</p>
            <p>When Saul was taken away, and Dauid was annoynted King in Hebron, Abner the ſonne of Ner Captaine of Sauls armie, tooke Iſhboſheth Sauls ſonne, and ſet him vp for King, the diſcorde then grew much greater: for then one part of the Tribes claue vnto Dauid, the other vnto the houſe of Saul. They were indeede all the ſonnes of Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob and profeſſed the God of Abraham, whom they ſhould with one mouth haue worſhipped and glorified, as Saint Paul ſaith, Rom. 15. verſ. 6. but they were diuided and rent aſunder, for there was bloudie warre and long time continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Tribes: 2. Sam. 2. and 3 Brethren with deadly hatred and enmitie purſuing their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſeeking the bloud each of other. It could not bee but that great calamities in this time of diſcorde did ouerſpread the whole land: they might by experience then, and did behold how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and how miſchieuous a thing it is, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be at variance.</p>
            <p>The cutting down of ſo great an euill, &amp; taking
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21168:130"/>away all occaſion is a very great good. Therefore when Abner and Iſheboſheth were ſlaine, all Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell came together and ſet vp Dauid. Then there grew a reconciliation of Tribe vnto Tribe, and they which were before rent aſunder, became a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine one body, brethren imbraced each other with loue, the bitter hatred before among them was cut downe and extinguiſhed. The worſhip of God was now ſet vp, the bleſſings of GOD were powred downe from heauen vpon them in great plentie, the whole land did reioyce with ioy and gladnes: Therefore hee willeth them now to beholde how good and how comely a thing it is, for brethren to dwell alſo at vnitie. Thus were they taught by their owne experience on both ſides: For they had found the greeuous annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of diſcorde, and enmitie on the one part, and the benefite of peace on the other, and this is it hee willeth them to beholde. Beholde how good and how comelie a thing it is, which doth cutte downe ſo great euill, and beholde how good and how comelie a thing it is, which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it ſuch great bleſſings of GOD: thus much for the firſt worde. Then to the praiſe it ſelfe: the firſt Epithite is (how good) which containeth the great fruite that ariſeth thereof, and is afterward ſet forth by the ſecond compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, that is, of the dewe of Hermon: for that is a thing fruitefull and good. The other is (how comelie) the worde is <hi>Magnim,</hi> which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21168:130"/>ſignifieth beautifull, ſweete, comelie, or pleaſant: as in Pſalme 16. where hee ſpeaketh of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and exaltation of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Thou wilt ſhewe me the path of life, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ioye is in thy preſence, at thy right hande comely pleaſures for euermore. This comely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſweetnes of concorde, is reſembled and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed foorth by the former ſimilitude, that is, of Aarons annointing: for that was a very comelie and a ſweete thing, and had a myſticall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To vnderſtand the better what is here meant, firſt ye may reade of this pretious oyntment, both wherof the Lord commanded it ſhould be made, and how Aaron &amp; his ſons ſhould bee annointed therewith vnto the Prieſts office, in Exod. 30. Then further we are taught in the Scriptures, that Aaron was a figure of Chriſt, and that this annointing of his with that precious ſweete oyntment, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſpirituall and heauenly annoynting of Chriſt Ieſus with the holie Ghoſt, whoſe graces diſtill from him the head, vpon euery part of his myſticall bodie, which is the Church. Of him it is ſayd, The ſpirit of the Lord is vpon me, becauſe he hath annoynted me, &amp;c. Luke 4. verſ. 18. Marke further then wherein the compariſon holdeth. Thus powring the precious oyntment vpon Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons head, running downe vpon his beard, and to the skirts of his clothing, was pleaſant to behold, and caſt foorth a ſweete ſauour vnto all that ſtood
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21168:131"/>round about. Alſo in that it deſcendeth vpon his beard, and ſo downeward vpon all parts euen to the skirts of his clothing, it reſembleth the graces of the holie Ghoſt flowing downe from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, vpon all the members of his bodie knit together in an holie vnitie. When it went downe from Aarons head vpon his bodie vnited to the ſame, it deſcendeth euen to the loweſt part of his garment, becauſe there is no rent nor ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Euen ſo the Church vnited vnto Chriſt her head, and euery member of the ſame vnited vnto the reſt in an holie vnion, and making one bodie, the heauenly graces of the holie Ghoſt, farre ſweeter then that precious oyntment, flow from him vpon them, and all are partakers thereof, euen the loweſt and meaneſt member, euen to the skirts. For where they are ioyned in this ſpirituall vnitie, looke what graces ſoeuer God from his ſonne Chriſt doth powre vpon the higheſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, (that is, vpon Princes and Paſtors) they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill alſo vpon the other parts and members, and ſo from each to other.</p>
            <p>That which was ſeparate from the head, from the bodie, and from the garments of Aaron, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued no drop of that precious oyntment, which deſcended from the head to a bodie vnited, and to all parts of the garments wrought together. In like manner the graces of the holy Ghoſt deſcend from Chriſt the head, vpon nothing that is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and deuided and rent from him, but vpon all
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:21168:131"/>the members vnited in one bodie. Wee may then briefly ſet foorth what this ſimilitude declareth, in this wiſe. The ſweete oyntment is powred vpon the head of Aaron, it goeth down vpon his beard, then vpon his ſhoulders, and all parts of his bodie euen to the loweſt border of his garments. Ieſus Chriſt the head of the Church is annoynted with the holie Ghoſt, and from him the ſweete graces deſcend, and come vpon al the bodie, and vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery member of the bodie euen to the meaneſt: this it is to bee vnited to him, and to his Church: this is a thing moſt ſweet and moſt comfortable.</p>
            <p>In the other ſimilitude he reſembleth this vnitie vnto the dew of Hermon, which commeth downe vpon the mountaines of Sion: the waters which fall vpon the high mountaine diſtill into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leies, but into thoſe valleies which are ioyned thereunto at the foote thereof, and make them plentiouſly fruitfull: euen ſo the heauenly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall dewes that come downe from aboue vpon the mountaines, flow vpon the valleies which are vnited thereunto, and there is great fruit, and all good things ſpringing from thence. Thus much wee may conſider in theſe ſimilitudes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe how good and how comely a thing it is for brethren alſo to dwell at vnitie.</p>
            <p>Now all this is from the moſt high God: for he ſaith (there) that is to ſay, vpon thoſe which dwell together in this holy vnitie, the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the bleſsing, and life for euermore.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21168:132"/>It is Gods vnchangeable decree that they ſhall haue the bleſſing, that is, the great great high bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, euen the bleſsing of all bleſsings in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting continuance. This can neuer faile, for God almightie is vnchaungeable, and what he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and commaunded, ſhall ſtande for euer. This may perſwade much to dwell in vnitie: for it is a goodly matter to bee vnder the bleſsing of almightie God: and there, that is, vpon the vnitie of brethren, he hath commended his bleſsing, and no where els: for this, there, is as much as to ſay, there onely.</p>
            <p>Now wee ſee the praiſe it ſelfe of vnitie and concorde heere ſet foorth vnto vs, it remaineth, that wee conſider to what ende and purpoſe the holie Ghoſt giueth this great commendation. This wee all knowe, that when a thing is diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it is to bring vs into a miſliking and ſhunning of the ſame, as a thing either vnpleaſant or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And contrariwiſe, praiſe, eſpecially where it is giuen by God, who knoweth the worthines of euene thing, is to drawe our liking, and to make vs in loue with that which is praiſed.</p>
            <p>This is then done heere, that wee may haue our hearts inflamed, and that wee may bee in loue with vnitie and concorde: and that wee maye ſtudiouſlie ſeeke after it, and imbrace it, as a moſt precious iewell: and finallie by all meanes take heede, that wee doe not any thing which may hinder and diſturbe the ſame. And
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:21168:132"/>doubtleſſe if this can not mooue vs, and kindle an earneſt loue and zeale to be ſtudious of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peace, that it is ſo good, ſo ſweet, and pleaſant, and that Gods bleſſing is vpon it vnto eternall life, how dull are we vnto ſpirituall and heauenly things, or what can mooue vs? Shall we not care to haue that cut down which bringeth miſchiefe and deſtruction, and to ſet vp that which carrieth all bleſſednes with it? Shall wee neither care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the curſe of God, plagues and puniſhments on the one ſide: nor yet couet to haue his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? that it may mooue vs the rather, I will come now to the application of this Pſalme to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
            <p>Wee haue (as yee all knowe) receiued great bleſſings from the Lord our God, by the meanes of our gracious Queene. For by her happy raigne, we haue enioyed long peace, euen ſuch as the like hath not almoſt beene ſeene or heard of in this land. Wee haue alſo great plentie of all things, our countrey ouerflowing with milke and hony: euery man fitting vnder his vine and vnder his figge tree. And moreouer, the Lord hath prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vs by her Scepter and power, from the inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of forraine enemies, and from the wicked practiſes and treaſons of domeſticall aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: theſe are great benefites receiued. But the greateſt bleſſing of all is, that by her gouernment he hath deliuered vs from the bondage of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, from the heauie yoke of Antichriſt, out of Idolatrie and blindnes, and hath reſtored vnto vs
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21168:133"/>his holy worde, and his true worſhip. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there hath beene among vs, many yeeres (as ye all know) great diſcorde and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that not onely againſt Papiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemies of the holy religion, but euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt brethren, which profeſſe the ſame holy doctrine and faith of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. In all this time we haue taſted the bitter fruits of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and diſcord, wee haue felt and fuſtained the miſchiefes, harmes, and dammages that growe from it, ſo that wee haue had experience with the Iſraelites in the worſer part, and can ſay of our owne knowledge, behold how euill and how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely a thing it is for brethren to bee at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. To make this more apparant, if I ſhould ſtand to rippe vp, and to lay open all the euils which haue alreadie come vpon vs by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of brethren, it would be a long and tedious labour. I will therefore onely note ſome of the chiefe and moſt generall, that beholding as it were our moſt grieuous wounds, wee may ſeeke to haue them ſalued and cured if it may pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, I may note as a principall euill fruit of enmitie, that it is a ioy, and an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement vnto the enemies of the Goſpell, the Papiſtes, for to ſee brethren ſet againſt brethren: for as it is in an armie of men, if they be at deadly variance among themſelues, Captaine againſt Captaine, band againſt band, purſuing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that the aduerſe part (againſt which they
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21168:133"/>ſhould wholly togither bend their forces) will ſay, wee ſhall not need to doe much, we ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily preuaile, for they will pull downe and deſtroy themſelues with their owne handes, and hereof will much reioyce. So is it in Gods Church, Chriſtes armie, which is ſet vpon by deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on euery ſide, when there is diſcord grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto ſharpe enmitie, and the leaders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues bent one part againſt another, the wicked enemie doth laugh, and receiueth boldneſſe and ſtrength, for he ſaith in his heart, This ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among them will proceed in the end e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto blood, and to the deſolation of both parts. O how much ought we to be pricked and grieued at the reioycing and boldning of Gods enemies? And how dolefull a calamitie were this, if it ſhoulde among brethren come vnto blood? We ſee that among the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, the enmitie and diſcord brake forth euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood, and ſo doubtleſſe, except the Lorde in great mercy turne it away (ſuch is the nature of contention when it groweth ſharpe) that the end among vs alſo will be moſt grieuous. This one euill ought to mooue vs to loue and imbrace the holy vnitie here commended in this Pſalme. I would the conſideration of it might be deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly printed in our mindes. The wounding of the weake is another great euill that ariſeth from diſcorde: doubtleſſe many are caſt downe, or turned out of the way, or at the leaſt wife are much hindred hereby in our Church. Stumbling
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21168:134"/>blockes being thus laide, before the blinde and lame. What pitie this ought to mooue, and how much the ſight of it ſhould vexe and grieue vs, the doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt vttered by him ſelfe and by his Apoſtles doth euery where ſhew: threatnings alſo &amp; woes are pronounced againſt them, that ſhall caſt downe the weake: and ſhall not wee regard this thing at all? ſhall neither the compaſſion and loue to our brethren for whome Chriſt died, nor the threatnings &amp; woes denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced take any place? Thirdly, the diſcord of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, doth bring both parts into contempt and diſgrace among many. And ſo by this meanes the miniſters of the Goſpell, the meſſengers of Chriſt, which ſhould be had in precious account and eſtimation for their workes ſake, euen as the veſſels of gold and ſiluer in the Lords temple, &amp; as the Angels of the Lorde of hoſtes, are baſely eſteemed, euen as if they were veſſels of earth or wood. If this did reach onely vnto the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or vnto their diſgrace, it were the leſſe, and might with leſſe griefe be borne: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſgrace reach indeed euen to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the men, the power of their miniſterie is weakened. For where the teacher is euill thought of and deſpiſed, the multitude doth not regard his doctrine. This euill goeth deepe, and if we conſider well of it togither with the former which I haue mentioned, yee ſhall ſee that vpon our owne experience we may ſay, indeed behold
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21168:134"/>how euill and how vncomely a thing it is, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be at enmitie and diſcord. Theſe euils do highly diſpleaſe Almighty God, and if they be continued in without redreſſe, who is able to ſhewe the puniſhments and calamities which in time will enſue and come vpon vs in this land? The contempt of the Goſpell, and growing into Atheiſme thereby, will drawe downe infinite plagues and miſeries. For the righteous God will not alwaies ſuffer ſuch abuſe vnreuenged. Then ſeeing vnitie is ſo good, bringing ſo many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; and diſcord ſo euill, drawing ſuch an heape of miſchiefes with it, the one as a nouriſher of true life, is to be ſought for and maintained by all godly Chriſtians, and the other is to be eſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a deadly peſtilence: and this is to be done of vs ſpeedily, becauſe diſſention is like the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of waters, the longer it continueth, the wider is the breach made, and ſo becommeth the more difficult to be recouered. This being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed of all, for there is no man I thinke that will denie, but that it is a moſt neceſſary thing in Gods Church and among brethren, to eſchewe diſcord and to ſeeke vnitie: therefore let vs in the next place conſider and vnderſtand how it is to be ſought: for let it be that we both agree, it is to be ſought, and alſo doe ſeeke for it; yet if we ſeeke not the right way, we are neuer the better for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Firſt then knowe this, that there are two ſorts of vnitie and agreement, the one is in God, being in the truth, in the ſpirite, in true holineſſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21168:135"/>and ſanctification. The other is in error and ſinne and not in the Lord. Now indeed it is the holy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in the Lord, which is praiſed in this Pſalme, and which we muſt ſeeke after, vpon which the bleſſing of God ſhall come. This may yee ſee by that exhortation of Saint Paul, Epheſ. 4. When hee ſaith, <hi>ſtudying to keepe the vnitie of the ſpirit in the band of peace:</hi> for hee addeth as the reaſon, <hi>There is one bodie, and one ſpirit, as yee are all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in hope of your calling: one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God and father of all, &amp;c.</hi> For like as all the members of the naturall bodie are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled togither by one ſoule and make but one bodie: ſo by one ſpirit of the Lord, all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are vnited, and become all one myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Ieſus Chriſt: by one faith, and by one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, they are all in one Lord, and in one God. The foundation of this vnitie is in the truth, and by it men grow vp togither in God: and for this cauſe it is ſaid in the firſt verſe of the Pſalme, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren alſo to dwell in vnitie:</hi> Hee ſaith <hi>(alſo)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as there is a reconciliation wrought by Chriſt betweene God and man, and ſo a man is come into vnitie with God, he muſt alſo growe into vnitie with thoſe which are togither recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Lorde with him: ſeeke this vnitie, to bee vnited with our brethren vnto God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, all ſhall be diſſolued and ſcattered againe in confuſion. Touching that other concorde which is in errour and wickedneſſe, they which poſſeſſe it (who are of diuers ſorts) do commend
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:21168:135"/>it, and much complaine of the diſturbance and breach thereof. As firſt of all the Papiſts make a great exclamation againſt vs which profeſſe the glorious Goſpell, and haue forſaken them: that like wicked Schiſmaticks we haue diſturbed and broken this holy vnitie, by rending our ſelues from the true Church, and ſo from the faith, and from Chriſtes myſticall bodie: this is a grieuous and a ſore accuſation, if their vnitie which they glorie of, were in the truth. But ſeeing it is moſt euident that they haue forſaken the truth of God, blaſpheme and condemne it, and ſet vp abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errours and curſed Idolatrie: all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements, all their holy league (as they tearme it) is no more but a moſt wicked and curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie againſt God and his people. What is their vnitie more then that which is deſcribed by the Prophet Dauid, Pſal. 2. Why do the Gentils rage, and the people meditate that which is vaine? The kings of the earth ſtand vp, and the Princes take counſell togither againſt the Lorde, and againſt his Chriſt? Here is a great vnitie, nay a conſpiracie of wicked traitors againſt Chriſt. This perplexitie is fulfilled by them: And wee haue the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God by the voice of the Angel, Come out from among them my people, and ſeparate your ſelues: ſo that all their cry is nothing againſt vs, wee haue not diſſolued this bleſſed vnity here commended, but haue forſaken their curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, which the neerer a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ioyned vnto, the further off he is from God. Let no man therefore
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:21168:136"/>be troubled or diſquieted by their great wordes, but forſaking them, imbrace the holy faith, and be vnited thereby togither with the Prophets and Apoſtles, and all holy men, vnto Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Ye ſhall heare many other ſorts of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that there is not fellowſhip and vnity kept with them. When indeede as they walke after their wicked and vncleane luſtes in all abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinnes, as in contempt of gods word, in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, whoredom, pride, ambition, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vſury, extortion, briberie, oppreſſion, enuie, and many ſuch like. The holy ghoſt ſaith vnto vs, <hi>Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes, but rather reprooue them,</hi> Epheſ. 5.11. We can not ioyne Chriſt and Belial, we can not be vnited to the Lord and haue fellowſhippe in wicked ſinnes. <hi>If wee ſay wee haue fellowſhip with him</hi> (ſaith S. Iohn) <hi>and walke in darkeneſſe, wee lie, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Iohn. verſ. 6. Epheſ. 5.11. Hee that crieth out for peace, and doth walke in vngodly waies, ſtraying from the truth and from ſanctification, whatſoeuer he will ſeeme to be, he is nothing els but a diſturber and breaker of all holy vnitie. For who can take part with him in thoſe things, but he ſhall ſeparate himſelfe (as I haue ſhewed) from truth and godlines, without which there can be no bleſſed vnitie? Saint Peter calleth our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt a liuing ſtone, vnto whome all the faithfull comming as liuing ſtones, are built vp and become a ſpirituall houſe. 1. Pet. 2. If ſtones be not ſquared and made ſmooth to fit &amp; ioyne
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:21168:136"/>togither, how ſhall they grow into one building? If men be not framed in faith and godlines, how ſhall they be vnited in the Lord? Indeede there be imperfections both in doctrine and manners, all the beſt he wen ſtones haue ſome ruggedneſſe remaining, and men muſt beare one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in much: for charitie muſt couer the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinnes. 1. Pet. 4 while the Temple of God is in the world, the ſtones are not perfectly ſet togither, but the worke is ſtill in hand, this Temple is ſtill in building, wee muſt beware of the downefall on that ſide alſo. Then ſeeing this bleſſed vnitie muſt be in God, in the truth, in the ſpirit, to be built vp in Chriſt Ieſus in true ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, (for hee that is in Chriſt is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:) and ſeeing all concord without this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, ſhall fall downe as a rotten building, let the holy booke of God be our ground, let it bee brought foorth to cut downe all controuerſies, and let men if they looke for any part of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing here promiſed, yeeld all honour and glorie vnto this ſacred word: yea let no man ſtand vpon his owne honour or reputation, if he haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any thing awry; but ſo ſoone as euer hee eſpieth the truth in any matter, yeeld thereunto, let the trueth of God goe before and lead vs the way. For this is the onely way to grow into this holy vnitie. And let ſuch as walke a wrie, forſake their euill waies, embrace the heauenly truth, and follow the rules thereof, if they will be accounted ſtudious of peace and concord. Ioyning thus vnto
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:21168:137"/>the truth, both in faith and godlines of life, wee ſhall be ioyned togither in the Lord, and it ſhall be ſaide, Behold how good and how comely a thing it is for brethren alſo to dwell at vnitie. It ſhall bee like that precious ointment vpon the head of Aaron, &amp;c. The heauenly graces &amp; gifts of the holy ghoſt, ſhall come downe vpon vs plenteouſly and flow vnto euerie member: wee ſhall bring foorth fruite vnto God watered with heauenly dewes: wee ſhall haue that great and high bleſſing of God almightie vnto eternall life. Therefore if it bee not too late, that the ſinnes of this land haue prouoked the Lorde to diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, let all men lift vp their hearts and crie vnto the Lord, that he will beſtow this precious iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell vpon vs, that wee may bee at vnitie (not in all manner of wicked vices, nor in errours) but in the Lord. And now who ſhall ſeeke this vnitie? who ſhall ſtudie to aduance it? This may be in queſtion. I anſwer, euen all ſtates and degrees of men, priuat perſons, rulers and teachers, euen all and euery one that wil looke for any part of gods bleſſing muſt aduance it. Euery man I ſay muſt looke vnto the heauenly truth of the holy religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and embrace the ſame with all loue and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affection. Euery man ought to be zealous in ſpirit for the glorie of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For if a man haue not the zeale of religion, hee can not be a good man, whether hee be ruler or priuate man, though hee ſeeme to be neuer ſo peaceable, but as the Lord ſaith to the Angell of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:21168:137"/>the Church of Laodicea, Reu. 3. <hi>Becauſe thou art neither hot nor colde, I vvill ſpewe thee out of my mouth:</hi> God doth reiect all ſuch dull and drowſie Atheiſtes, and irreligious perſons, which are ſo earthly minded, as that they regard not the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly graces which are offered in the Goſpell. Let all men therefore ſtirre vp their heartes to be feruent in Gods truth, and let not godly zeale be quenched. Then further (as I haue alſo ſhewed before) wee muſt ioyne the practiſe of this holy word, as the Apoſtle S. Iames willeth: <hi>Be doers of the worde and not hearers onely, deceiuing your ſelues.</hi> Iam. 2.19. for the great diſturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of peace &amp; the grieuous breaches of vnity, &amp; all bitter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions do chiefly ariſe from hence, that all ſorts &amp; degrees of men walke not in the rules which God hath preſcribed vnto them in his word. Wee muſt therefore enter more particularly into this matter, that we may ſee how ech ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to further this bleſſed vnitie. I begin with the priuat perſon, for whome there are rules preſcribed in Gods word for him to obſerue, if he wil be a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, &amp; a ſeeker &amp; preſeruer of this vnitie, &amp; ſo a partaker of Gods bleſſing vnto life euerlaſting. One rule is touching ſubiection &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence vnto gouernors both ciuill and eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall: for God hath commanded to honor &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them. Submit your ſelues vnto all manner or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of man, for the Lords ſake: whether it be vnto the king, as vnto the ſuperiour; or vnto go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, as vnto them that are ſent of him, for the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:21168:138"/>puniſhment of euill doers, and for the praiſe of them that doe well. 1. Pet. 2. v. 13, 14. Alſo of this obedience and ſubiection for conſcience ſake, of this reuerence and honour to be rendred, S. Paul writeth, Rom. 13. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Likewiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them that haue the ouerſight of you, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelues, for they watch for your ſoules as they that muſt giue accounts, &amp;c. Heb. 13.17. The neglect and breach of this rule, euen the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of obedience, reuerence, and honour vnto the rulers, gouernours, and teachers, diſturbeth and ouerthroweth the vnitie which is here prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. If then a man will not make conſcience to performe this dutie in obeying the holy doctrine of the Lord, what is he other then an enemy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true concord, a diſſoluer of vnitie &amp; peace? But what if rulers offend, paſtors and gouernors faile, and come ſhort in ſome duties, and therby ſeeme vnworthy to be regarded? I ſay if they do, they ſhall anſwer before God for it, but yet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men are not ſet at libertie, they are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from this obedience and rendring honor vnto them: for it is vnto the authoritie, and vnto Gods ordinance that they doe it, and not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of man. God hath not preſcribed the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men which are to be done vnto others, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this condition, if they perfourme all that which they ought to doe on their parts, or if they be ſuch maner of men as they ought to be. But he hath preſcribed euery mans duty abſolutely. If an other faile in his, hee ſhall anſwer (as I ſaid) for it
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:21168:138"/>before God, thou haſt no warrant hereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the rule which God hath ſet vnto thee. For thou art tied in conſcience vnto God to obey his will, &amp; not in regard of man, or of thine owne benefit to doe this or that: for by the doctrine of the bleſſed Apoſtle, wee ſee that Chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and faithfull ſeruants, are commanded euen for conſcience to giue honour vnto heathen prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and infidell maſters, Rom. 13.1. Tim. 6.1. wee muſt then from this expreſſe worde of God obſerue, that when gouernours doe amiſſe, men haue not their tongues ſet at libertie to reuile, and to reproch them, or to diſhonour them with euil ſpeech; ſeeing it is alſo written, Thou ſhalt not curſe the ruler of the people. Exod. 22. v. 28. But contrariwiſe, praiers and ſupplications are to be made vnto God, for rulers and teachers of the Lords people. When they offend, it is with great hurt to the Church, and therefore men are to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mourne for it, and not to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues merrie with ieſtes and reproches. Let all euill ſpeeches of diſgrace then be turned into praiers, and the laughter into teares, for this ſhall be more pleaſing vnto God. Let no man beare himſelfe in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that he is not guilty of the breach of holy concord, when he obſerueth not the rules of this doctrine, of ſubmiſſion, of reuerence and honour to be giuen vnto gouernours.</p>
            <p>Another rule is giuen by the Apoſtle, in theſe words: That ye ſtudie to be quiet, and to meddle with your owne buſineſſe, and to worke with
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:21168:139"/>your owne handes, &amp;c. 1. Theſſ. 4.11. as God hath diſtributed vnto euerie man, and as the Lord hath called euerie one (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſo let him walke, and ſo ordaine I in all Churches. 1. Cor. 7.17. God hath ordained the ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and callings, he hath giuen gifts of abilitie to men to perfourme the things he requireth in the ſame: he hath alſo ſet the bounds &amp; limits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which euerie one is to keepe himſelfe, and to walke orderly, medling with that which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth vnto him. This is an holy thing &amp; come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a preſeruer of vnitie; but it is much broken, and great euill enſueth thereof: for there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuat perſons, which would ſeeme verie reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and to ſeeke the holy vnity aboue others, which leaue the duties of their places and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and buſie themſelues wholly with thoſe matters which doe not belong vnto them. For as if the matters of their trades and ſciences were too baſe, or as if the care of their familie were a thing ouer vile, they ſet theſe aſide, and neglect them, and take vpon them greater and higher buſineſſe. For beholding any thing amiſſe in the Church, as if God had ſet them to be ouerſeers of the gouernours and teachers, contrarie vnto this rule of Saint Paul, They labour not with their hands, nor meddle quietly with their owne buſineſſe, but they bende all the powers of their minde, to diſpute and reaſon about gouernment, and the duties of gouernours and teachers, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring about, and ſeeking to perſwade and draw
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:21168:139"/>others to their minde. They thinke thus to doe God high ſeruice: But who hath giuen them power to diſpenſe with this rule, that yee ſtudie to be quiet, and to meddle with your owne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and to labour with your handes? Hath God called them and ſet them a worke about greater things, and freed them from theſe? Is it not the ordinance and will of our God, that men ſhall inſtruct &amp; guide their families in his waies? Is there not labour and paines and care to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the children and ſeruants may learne the holy doctrine and walke in it? But there are many which deepely meddle in publique mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and if they haue two or three children and as many ſeruants, they are left ignorant, no paines taken about them, they may walke awrie many waies, the care thereof is little. Alſo a mans owne matters which Saint Paul willeth to meddle with, are in prouiding earthly things, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for his family: ſo that Saint Paul ſaith. If there be any that prouideth not for his owne, namely for them of his family, hee denieth the faith, and is worſe then an infidell. 1. Timoth. 5.8. and ſo in other duties. Shall we thinke the trueth is obeyed, or that God is pleaſed by ſuch waies? when the rulers and guides of Gods people doe amiſſe, a man is to ſorrow at it, he is to looke to his way that hee keepe vpright before God: but when in reprehending that which others fault in, he neglecteth his owne calling, how ſhall hee eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue this ſentence, Thou art therfore inexcuſable
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:21168:140"/>O man) whoſoeuer thou art that iudgeſt another, for in that thou iudgeſt another, thou condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thy ſelfe: for thou doeſt the ſame things that thou iudgeſt, Rom. 2. v. 1. Thou leaueſt vndone thy duty in guiding that ſmal charge committed vnto thee. And let vs make the compariſon, Is hee not more worthie blame that findeth fault with the greater, and doeth it not in the leſſer, when the greater is more difficult to be perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? It is harder to gouerne a whole kingdome, a citie, or a flocke, then a little familie, and more faultes will appeare. How vnreaſonable a thing then is it that a man which guideth not his little family in any ſuch order as god requireth, ſhould let goe the ſight of his owne defects, and whollie giue himſelfe in ſpeech to depraue the publike guides. Lament and ſorrow for euill, conſent not thereunto in any wiſe, follow the waies of the Lord, obey the rules of the word: and therfore let al men regard this, &amp; keep their place &amp; ſtanding which God hath ſet them in, and ſo walke, as that they may anſwer before the high iudge, and giue account how they haue diſcharged their dutie.</p>
            <p>To come now to the gouernors and guides of the Lordes people: and firſt to the paſtours and ſhepheards which haue the power and authoritie eccleſiaſticall. Theſe are principall, and aboue all other, and after a ſpeciall ſort to procure, and to preſerue this bleſſed vnitie, as the end for which they are giuen of Chriſt, doth ſhew. He hath (ſaith S. Paul) giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Prophets,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:21168:140"/>ſome Euangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and teachers: and then he ſheweth to what end, ſaying, for the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Saints, for the work of the miniſterie, &amp; for the edification of the bodie of Chriſt: till wee all meete together in the vnitie of faith, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the ſonne of God, vnto a perfect man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulnes of Chriſt, &amp;c. Ephe. 4. verſ. 11.12.13. This is their whole worke and labour appointed them, euen to build vp Chriſts bodie, the temple of God, by fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and coupling together the liuing ſtones, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that vnitie of brethren, which is commended in this Pſalme. Then let vs ſee the rules preſcribed in Gods word, which they muſt obſerue to performe this holy worke. The Elders (ſaith S. Peter) that are among you, I beſeech, which am alſo an Elder and a witneſſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt, &amp; alſo a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the glorie that ſhall be reuealed, feede the flocke of God which dependeth vpon you caring for it not by conſtraint, but willingly: not for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie lucre, but of a readie mind: not as though ye were Lords ouer Gods heritage, but that ye may be examples to the flocke. 1. Pet 5. verſ. 1.2.</p>
            <p>Firſt the ſheepe of Chriſt are to haue food, their life dependeth thereupon. It is required therefore in all ſhepheards that will anſwer their calling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, to haue the ſame affection in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Chriſt had: who when hee ſaw the multitude he had compaſsion on them, becauſe they were as ſheepe without a ſhepheard, Mat. 9.36. Pitie and compaſsion vpon the ſtraying ſheepe muſt moue
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:21168:141"/>them to ſeed: yea loue muſt conſtraine. For Chriſt ſaith to Peter, Simon Ioanna loueſt thou me more then theſe? feed my ſheepe: loueſt thou me? feede my lambes: loueſt thou me? feed my ſheepe: as if he ſhould ſay, of all loue do this for me. Here I am to mooue thoſe which bee in authoritie in the Church, if it may any way come to their eares, I do humbly beſeech the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, to haue compaſsion vpon the flocke, that the ſheepe may haue their appoynted foode, euen the bread of life plentifully broken vnto them, that they may be led into the greene paſtures, &amp; vnto the fountaines and ſtreames of the liuing waters: cry alſo vnto the Lord of the harueſt, that hee will powre downe his ſpirit vpon them, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion, there may bee labourers ſent foorth: and that ſuch as haue taken vpon them the charge, and be idle or abſent, may be compelled to doe their dutie: that ſuch as bee not able to feede, or that walke in a diſſolute and wicked behauiour in life and conuerſation, may bee remoued: And that ſuch as bee both skilfull to teach, and of godlie life, may bee ſet ouer them, to guide them both by doctrine and example. If this be not per formed, how is the true concord and vnitie ſought? If the people bee not inſtructed and led in the way of godlines: how ſhall they be framed and built to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one holie temple? If the Shepheard bee vngodly, and giue corrupt example: what peace, what vnitie, or what agreement can ſuch as will feare God, hold with him? And if there be a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21168:141"/>betweene the ſheepe and the ſhepheard, where ſhall be the vnitie of brethren? It is out of all controuerſie that the meane to worke the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnitie of brethren, is, that the flocke of Chriſt be fedde and guided by skilfull godly men, which teach doctrine, and giue good example in life and conuerſation.</p>
            <p>And now touching the care of the flocke, not by conſtraint, nor for gaine, but willingly and of a readie mind: not as Lords ouer Gods heritage, but as examples to the flock; I doe againe inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſeech the paſtors and gouernours euen for Chriſts ſake, to abound and to increaſe in all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue towards the Lords people, without which this care cannot rightly be performed. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low herein the example of Saint Paul, who ſetting foorth his labour and trauaile, not of ambition or deſire of gaine, nor with roughnes, but as he ſaith, we were gentle among you euen as a nurſe cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth her children. <hi>1.</hi> Theſſ. 2. ver. 7. where this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue is broken off, there followeth (to the exceeding decay and deſolation of the Church) that which the Lord complained of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ezechiel againſt the paſtors of Iſrael. Woe be vnto the ſhepheards of Iſrael, that feede them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: ſhould not the ſhepheards feed the flocks? Ye eate the fat, and ye clothe ye with the wooll: ye kill them that are fed, but ye ſeed not the ſheep: the weake haue ye not ſtrengthened: the ſick haue ye not healed, neither haue ye bound vp the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor brought againe that which was driuen
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21168:142"/>away: neither haue ye ſought that which was loſt, but with violence, and with crueltie haue ye ruled them. Ezec. 24. verſ. 3.4. This was the ſtate of the flocke then, and ſhall be euen to the worlds ende: that among Chriſts ſheepe as ſome be ſtrong, ſo ſome bee weake, ſome ſicke, ſome going aſtray. Yea ſuch are the frailties of all the faithfull, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the errors and the ſinnes which doe breake foorth: but yet they are ſtill the ſheepe of Chriſt, the Iſrael of God, and the ſhepheards of Iſrael are to looke to them. Now I ſay, if there bee not a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue in the ſhepheards to couer the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinnes: if there be not a tender compaſsion, as in the Nurſe towards the little babe, in ſtead of care to heale the broken and ſick, &amp; to ſupport the weake, to bring into the way that which ſtraieth, they ſhall deſpiſe and lothe them as not worthie to bee regarded, yea they ſhall with violence and rigor beate and bruſe them, certaine it is, that the greater the frailties are, the greater care and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion is to be ſhewed. So that violence &amp; rigor are not fit to bee in the ſhepheards. For ſhall the nurſe throw the little infant againſt the ſtones, or puſh it forward when it can hardly ſtand alone? Shall the ſhepheard take his ſtaffe and ſtrike the young and tender Lambes? or ſhall he beate and bruſe the weake and feeble ſheepe? What ſhall we ſay, are the ſheepe of Chriſt of leſſe valew? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are weake and feeble in knowledge, many of them are but as young babes, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirituall power of ſanctification. A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:21168:142"/>of ſins doe breake from them. Many are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in conſcience and troubled in ſpirit: here is place for the loue, the care, the compaſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Shepheards. O ye ſhepheards of Iſrael put on this loue and compaſsion, lothe not the ſheepe of Chriſt for theſe frailties, rule them not with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and crueltie: but feed and ſupport, and heale them with all meeknes and long ſuffering. Let no peruerſnes or iniuries of any of the ſheep towards the ſhepheards, breake off the courſe of this loue and care. For if they look vnto this, how the ſheep deſpiſe them, how they walke ſtubbornly againſt them, they ſhall neuer bee able with patience and meekenes to goe through with the worke. If wee thinke it an vnworthie thing, or ſuch as doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſhepheard from his tender loue &amp; care, or that may warrant him to bee rigorous, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſheepe do not reuerence him. Look vpon Moſes and Paul two great &amp; notable ſeruants of God, two ſpeciall ſhepheards of the Lords flocke, who is worthie to be compared with them? They haue left an example to be followed. How great things did Moſes for the people? And yet how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did they murmur againſt him, and were readie to ſtone him? How many were their rebellions and iniuries done vnto him? And yet his loue is not quenched, his care doth not faile, but his prayer is moſt earneſt vnto God to pardon them: he ſtill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth them (though not all) as the Lords cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen people. What can they doe more vnto vs, then goe about to ſtone vs? Behold alſo the exceeding
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21168:143"/>aboundant loue of Paul, who wiſhed himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from Chriſt, that his kinſemen the Iewes which were obſtinate might be ſaued. How much greater was his loue to the faithfull of his kindred? And yet could they, euen the Church of Ieruſalem, ſcarſe think any thing well of him al the time that he liued, but thought hardly of him, though he did neuer ſo much for them? This is gathered by that which he writeth, Rom. 15. where he firſt ſheweth that it had pleaſed them of Macedonia &amp; Achaia to giue ſomwhat to the poore Saints in Ieruſalem, and that he went with this their beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſee it deliuered: and then he intreated them to be verie earneſt in praier to God for him, that he might be deliuered from the diſobedience of Iudea, and that his miniſterie towards Ieruſalem might be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Saints. It is a marueilous thing to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there being ſo great need in the Church at Ieruſalem, and that money being ſo welcome to thoſe which are in penurie, &amp; he carying ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull ſtore, yet there needeth earneſt prayers that this his ſeruice might be accepted. He had moued the Churches of the Gentiles, (as appeareth in his ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians) to make this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall contribution. He wrought this matter, he goeth vp with it, ſo great was his care. Yet when he ſhewethal this loue and diligence towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how great was their miſliking of him, that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his miniſtrie would not be acceptable to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? The cauſe of the miſliking, Iames doth ſhew vnto him when he was come vp, Act. 21. ver. 21. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:21168:143"/>that it was reported hee had taught the Iewes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles to depart from Moſes, and not to circumciſe their children. Wee ſee hee loueth them deerely for all this, and calleth them ſaints: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their great frailtie in this matter, &amp; the hard opinion they conceiued and held of him, ſo great and ſo worthie a ſeruant of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. What a paterne of meekenes &amp; fatherly loue is here for all the ſhepheards of the Lords flocke to follow, among the poore feeble and wandring ſheepe, which doe not ſo reuerence and regard them as they ought to doe. The ſhepheards as S. Peter requireth, muſt bee examples to the flockes, and therefore of all other are to ſhew meekenes, long ſuffering, and that loue which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the multitude of ſinnes. Where the paſtors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in this fatherly loue, and doe not fall vpon the fraile ſheepe and tender lambes with rigour and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the bleſſed vnitie of brethren here praiſed is chiefly furthered: for the building vp of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in ſanctification, is greatly aduanced by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the paſtors and teachers. The multitude are drawne thereby to imbrace and to follow the trueth. I doe therefore againe humbly beſeech all the paſtors and guides of the Lords people, to conſider of this holy rule and worthie examples, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, that the people of the Lord may bee brought into true concorde and brotherly amitie. Then laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it appertaineth alſo vnto rulers in ciuill matters to maintaine this vnitie according to the trueth. They are to miniſter iuſtice &amp; true iudgement vnto all, to puniſh the euill doers, and to cheriſh &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21168:144"/>the good. Mercie &amp; loue is alſo neceſſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in them, that they may deale euen as fathers when they correct &amp; chaſtiſe. If this be not, there will great miſchiefes enſue, euen to the diſturbance of all godly peace and concord: for let a ruler, a Iudge, or a mightie man be void of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and withall giuen to anger, dealing among the Lords weake and feeble ſheepe, he will be readie to beate them downe and to cruſh them in pieces. The frailties and ſins are many that breake foorth euen from ſome of Chriſts ſheepe &amp; lambes (as we ſee, there be the weake, the ſicke, the bruſed, and ſuch as erre) the thing is odious in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they profeſſe holineſſe, and therefore cannot in them be borne: therefore lift vp your hearts in earneſt praier vnto God, that he will powre downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of fatherly loue and mercie vpon rulers and iudges, that they may deale in the Lords flocke, and towards his poore weak ſheep, with ſuch regard as that they may anſwer before Chriſt. Thus if we honour and imbrace the truth, if we practiſe the rules therof, euery one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe duties which the Lord inioyneth, the rulers and iudges, paſtors &amp; gouernors in the church, as alſo the priuate perſons, we ſhal grow into this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnitie which the holy Ghoſt here praiſeth, we ſhall receiue all heauenly gifts and bleſsings, yea euen that great bleſsing of all bleſsings, the lfie for euermore. Grant this vnto vs O Lord, for thy deare ſonnes ſake our redeemer and Sauiour: to whom with thee and the holy Ghoſt, three perſons, &amp; one euerlaſting God, whom we worſhip, be all honour, glorie, dominion and power, for euermore. Amen.</p>
